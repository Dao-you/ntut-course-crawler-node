In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

the packet routing layer as provided by IP and routing mechanisms and protocols (RIP, BGP); the physical layer of LANs and media technologies (Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, bridging); the physical layer of WANs (modulation, multiplexing, T1) and emergi"},"id":"139002","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1403","code":"1403"}],"teacher":[{"name":"王永鐘","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=11008","code":"11008"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["5","6","7"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"綜科511","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=211","code":"211"}],"people":"22","peopleWithdraw":"1","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105077","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=139002&code=11008"]},{"code":"3105102","name":{"zh":"電力系統保護與協調","en":"Power System Protetion and Coordination"},"description":{"zh":"一.電力設備的故障二.比壓器,比流器三.保護電驛的構造及動作原理四.常用的保護電驛五.發電機與電動機的保護六.變壓器的保護七.線路保護八.異常電壓的預防九.熔絲十.保護協調","en":"<一>INTRODUCTION<二>WHAT REALLY IS THE MVA METHOD<三>THE ABC OF THE MVA<四>WHY THE MVA METHOD<五>COMPARISON OF THREE METHODS<六>CAN PHASE-GROUND FAULT BE SOLVED <七>MVA METHODS FOR INSTANTANEOUS VOLTAGE ESTIMATE<八>THE SIMPLE COMPUTER TIME SHARE PROGRAM<九>CONCLUSION"},"id":"139009","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1403","code":"1403"}],"teacher":[{"name":"周至如","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=11244","code":"11244"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["2","3","4"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"二教205(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=23","code":"23"}],"people":"38","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105102","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=139009&code=11244"]},{"code":"3105109","name":{"zh":"切換式電源設計","en":"Design of switching mode power supply"},"description":{"zh":"1.簡介2.功率級電路3.轉換器架構與分析4.控制電路5.回授電路6.保護電路7.電路佈局與機構8.應用電路分析","en":"1.Introduction2.Power Stage Circuit3.Converter Topology4.Control Circuit5.Feedback Circuit6.Circuit Protection7.Circuit Layout and Machanism8.Application Circuit"},"id":"139012","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1403","code":"1403"}],"teacher":[{"name":"歐勝源","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=11214","code":"11214"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":["6","7","8"],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"六教626(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=446","code":"446"}],"people":"26","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105109","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=139012&code=11214"]},{"code":"3105128","name":{"zh":"排隊理論","en":"Queueing Theory"},"description":{"zh":"本課程之教學目標在使學生瞭解排隊理論之基本概念及分析方法，並據以分析通訊網路或計算機網路之效能。課程內容包含：(1)排隊理論簡介 (2)相關機率理論 (3)基本排隊模式 (4)各種排隊模式分析 (5)排隊理論應用於各種通訊網路及計算機網路之效能分析。","en":"This course contains the Introduction of Queueing Theory, Related probability theory, Fundamental Queueing models, Queueing models analysis: M/M/1, M/M/c, M/E/1, M/G/1, G/M/1 etc. This course also contains the performance evaluation of communications networks and computer networks based on the queueing theory."},"id":"139019","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1403","code":"1403"}],"teacher":[{"name":"蔡堆","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=22668","code":"22668"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":["7","8","9"],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"二教302(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=27","code":"27"}],"people":"9","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105128","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=139019&code=22668"]},{"code":"3105134","name":{"zh":"行動通訊網路原理與實務","en":"Mobile Telecommunication Networks Principles and Practice"},"description":{"zh":"本課程旨在增進電機工程研究所學生對行動電話通訊網路工程實務之了解與分析設計之實作能力，期望學生之所學能與產業科技發展的脈動同步。 內容主要包括： (一) 電信基本概要簡介 (二) 行動電話通訊系統之演進與發展 (三) 蜂巢式行動電話基本網路架構與功能 (四) 臺灣GSM網路運作實例研討 (五) 無線網路之規劃設計與工程實務 (1)信號涵蓋之電腦模擬與路測技術 (2)通話流量與系統容量分析 (3)頻率規劃與干擾研究 (六) 系統優化與網路維運管理實務 (七) 電信公司營運機房與網管中心實地參觀 (八) 射頻規劃之電腦軟體模擬實驗: 在系裡經費許可之前提下提供學生實習網路規劃。","en":"This course aims to improve EE graduate student's knowledge in mobile telecommunication networks with emphasis on the engineering practice, as well as to train the students to be able to design and analyze the mobile telecommunication networks.

There are three consecutives parts in the one-semester lecture:The 1st part : (a)the nature of light, (b)the related theorems about reflection and refraction, (c) image formation.The 2nd part : the formation and correctness of aberrations.The 3rd part : the designing of lenses."},"id":"141271","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"四電資二","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1263","code":"1263"}],"teacher":[{"name":"林世穆","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=10260","code":"10260"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["5","6","7"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"共同413(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=157","code":"157"}],"people":"11","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"四光二與四電資二合開","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=6502006","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=141271&code=10260"]},{"code":"3203047","name":{"zh":"生物化學工程","en":"Biochemical Engineering"},"description":{"zh":"結合生物技術與化工原理來進行微生物、動、植物細胞之培養、酵素之提取、反應動力學、生物反應器的操作與相關參考數之獲取法、產品之分離程序等。","en":"In combination of biotechnology and chemical engineering to learn cell incubation, enzyme purification, bioreactor operation, and product separation, etc."},"id":"141277","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"四化四甲","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1041","code":"1041"},{"name":"四化四乙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1042","code":"1042"}],"teacher":[{"name":"侯劭毅","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=10955","code":"10955"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["5"],"wed":[],"thu":["3","4"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"二教307(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=32","code":"32"},{"name":"科研大樓242","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=461","code":"461"}],"people":"15","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"修課上限35人","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3203047","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=141277&code=10955"]},{"code":"3203077","name":{"zh":"太陽光電池應用與展望","en":"Technical progress and future prospect on solar photovoltaic"},"description":{"zh":"本課程在教授學生太陽能光電科技及能源相關產業及製程技術之實務知識。課程設計將著重基礎太陽能光電科技知識的建立,首先介紹太陽能光電科技所應具備之基本知識,並教授能源材料的基本特性及原理以及目前應用概況.藉由說明太陽能電池之設計原理與效率提高準則為出發點，教導學生了解太陽能光電科技所應用到之材料基本特性及相關製作程序。本課程將由本校專任教師配合企業講師和技術實務專業教師演講,透過實例之講解及工廠參觀，引導學生了解應用領域及製造產業。期盼培育學生迅速進入太陽能光電及能源材料相關產業工作能力與競爭力。","en":"The course is to provide the core knowledge for the development of solar energy technology.

You are encouraged to utilize the composition principle of black, white and gray, and emphasize more on the vividness than the form until you get rid of the habit of passive copying of the objects.
