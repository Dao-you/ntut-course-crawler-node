What meaningful definitions can we make about popular culture, and, perhaps more importantly, in what ways does popular culture define us?  Features of popular culture that we will study in this class include forms of pop iconography found present in music, film, television and in an ever-expanding arsenal of new media.  Our study will be considered only partially complete if we consider primarily the content of the media under investigation.  The larger question I shall call upon you to explore is how, in conjunction with (or in subordination to) its content, the form of the media itself shapes the way we think about ourselves and the world.\n\nStudents will be asked to, in coordination with a small group of fellow students give give two 10-15 minute presentations over the course of the semester.  Although the presentation need not be (and preferably should not be) scripted or read-aloud, each must be accompanied by a one-two page informal reflection to be handed in on the day of the presentation.  To help make sense of the immense body of pop culture which inculcates us at every turn, I have taken the liberty of coining a new term “iconotype,” to isolate the separate (though often merged) iconographic tropes which form the body of popular culture today.\n\nICONOTYPES\n\nPart One (A)\nIntroduction:  The Cowboy\nI.
