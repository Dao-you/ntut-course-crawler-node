The solution process includes data collection and problem investigation, model formulation, optimal solution derivation, cost and efficiency analysis, system implementation and execution etc. This course mainly contains various application cases. Accordingly, participant can understand how to apply theoretical methods on solving real problems. Computational software is also utilized to solve the formulated models and analyze and interpret the obtained solutions.\n本課程之目的在探討如何運用科學與系統化的方式解決管理上的問題。整個過程包括：資料蒐集與問題分析、數量模式的建構、問題求解、成本效益分析、系統規劃設計與執行等步驟。課程內容主要以應用案例說明為主，讓同學瞭解理論如何與實際問題結合，也會介紹最佳化計算軟體來求解數學模式並輔助說明所得數據之意涵。\n","schedule":"1:Introduction to Management Science.\n2:Linear programming: application problems.\n3:Linear programming: application problems.\n4:Linear programming: application problems.\n5:Linear programming: application problems.\n6:Simplex method.\n7:Duality and sensitivity analysis (Homework 1 due).\n8:Homework 1 presentation and review.\n9:Midterm exam.\n10:Goal programming.\n11:Goal programming.\n12:Integer linear programming: application problems.\n13:Integer linear programming: application problems.\n14:Integer linear programming: application problems.\n15:Decision analysis.\n16:Decision analysis (Homework 2 due).\n17:Homework 2 presentation and review.\n18:Final exam.","scorePolicy":"Homework: 25%\nMidterm: 30%\nFinal: 30%\nPresent situation: 15% (No more than three absences)\n","materials":"Textbook: Hamdy A.
