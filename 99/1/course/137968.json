It therefore encompasses water in rivers, lakes, aquifers and glaciers. Hydrology embraces a wide range of interests including scientific and engineering applications.  This class will largely stress the engineering hydrology.","schedule":"Unit 1:  　　Introduction\nUnit 2:  　　Meteorology and Precipitation\nUnit 3:  　　Losses from Precipitation\nUnit 4:  　　Basin and River\nUnit 5:  　　Hydrograph\nUnit 6:  　　Flood Routing\nUnit 7:  　　Statistics and Probabilities in Hydrology\nUnit 8:  　　Ground Water\n","scorePolicy":"Class attendance is required.
