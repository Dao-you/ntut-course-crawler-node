In this course, I will provide you the fundamental knowledge and training to cross over the hurdles in front of you. Mainly, this course will cover six major parts: First section is the introduction. Second are the functional aspects. The third is the static aspects. The fourth is dynamic aspect. The fifth is the deploying aspect. The sixth is the design aspect. All of them are the fundamental training to let you understand the skill of system analysis and design. However, I will provide the training materials from the most recent website to let you practice the design skill of Jude software with Professional tool. From the real operations of software, you can really understand the skill of JUDE (http://jude.esm.jp). Learning methodology:\n●Tool’s setup and build the basic environment on NB.\n●Learn the basic programming material from basic Java text book\n●Learn JUDE’s tool &amp; JC creator tool for Java.\n●Learn the international examination of SCJP.\n●Familiar the operation of professional JUDE tool.\n●Learn Hibernate 3.x to have better operation of Backend center.\n","schedule":"09/14 ch01 Introduction( OO System Development) (介紹篇:系統開發概論)\n09/21 ch02 UML Introduction (簡介)\n09/28 ch03 Suggestion plan (建議計畫與實施)\n10/05 ch04 Requirement Analysis and acquire (需求分析與擷取)\n10/12 ch05 Case study (使用案例圖)\n10/19 ch06 Circumstance (情節)\n10/26 ch07 Activity diagram (活動圖)\n11/02 ch08 Class Diagram (類別圖) Concept modeling (概念模型)\n11/09 ch09 Midterm Test\n11/16 ch10 Object Diagram (物件圖)\n11/23 ch11 Interaction Diagram (互動圖)\n11/30 ch12 Advanced Analysis (進階分析)\n12/07 ch13 Operation (操作)\n12/14 ch14 State Diagram (狀態圖)\n12/21 ch15 Element &amp; Deploy Diagram (元件圖與部屬圖)\n12/28 ch16 Design Principle (設計原則)\n01/04 Ch17 Model View Controller (MVC) Introduction (設計樣式簡介)\n01/11 Ch 18 Final Examination\n","scorePolicy":"The course content will base on the teaching materials on textbook and special materials obtained from working projects.
