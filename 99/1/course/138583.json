Students will read and discuss primary and secondary sources from Eastern and Western wisdom traditions and compose four short (3-5 page) papers and one medium length (5-8 page) essay based on these works.  Today, the first day of class, you will be given a primary text which will hopefully lead each of you into a differing (through sometimes intersecting) fields of investigation.  You should look at your initial text as a sort of clue in a larger mystery, for which, however, there is no single denouement.  Although your research Assignment must draw upon your primary text, it will be your responsibility to find more research materials--books, articles, films, interviews, musical compositions, poems, stories, works of art of all sorts--on your topic.  It will also be up to you to find an angle on your material: perhaps it will be a study of the culture, mythology, religion, or lifestyle from which your original source is drawn. Perhaps it will be a comparative work—examining beliefs from more than one culture.  As long as your final result includes the first text you selected in some significant manner, you will have accomplished the task I am assigning.","schedule":"September 12　　Introduction  ASSIGNMENT:  Journal Entry (JE) #1: Articulating your questions\n\nSeptember 19　　Discussion of primary texts.  \n\nSeptember 26　　Discuss Secondary Texts.
