Though novels have become the dominant and most prestigious literary form in the modern period, stories and tales have always been a favorite means of sharing ideas.  Their style and structure allow them to be retold more easily than a lengthy novel; and where novel reading is largely a private experience, tale telling was very often a public one.  The length of a story has no impact on its value, however.  Like novels, good tales are thoughtful and complex.  They reward close reading and re-reading, and provide students a good introduction to the vocabulary and the skills necessary for the study of literature and culture.  Drawing on stories from various periods of Western history, this course explores the issue of monstrosity – asking why so many story tellers feature elements outside the realm of everyday experience, against nature, beyond the norm of culturally accepted behavior: monsters and magic, the demonic and the alien, the supernatural and the unnatural.","schedule":"1: 　　Introduction\n2-4:　　Gawain and the Green Knight\n5-6:　　Chaucer, “The Franklin’s Tale” \n7-8:　　Swift, Gulliver’s Travels (Book 2)\n9:　　midterm\n10-12:　　Carroll, Alice in Wonderland\n13-15:　　Poe, “The Black Cat” \n16-17:　　Hawthorne, “Rappacini’s Daughter”","scorePolicy":"Midterm: 50%\nFinal: 50%\nAttendance: a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
