Then, the modern quantum chemistry will be introduced to make students familiarized the modern chemistry approach on the interpretation of the physical chemistry phenomena in material and biological science. This includes the introduction to quantum world, Schrodinger equation, chemical bonding, molecular shape and structure and so on. Later, the thermodynamics be applied to the interpretation of  physical and chemical equilibrium, acids and bases, aqueous equilibrium and electrochemistry.","schedule":"Week 1: Fundamental and Review\nWeek 2: Fundamental and Review\nWeek 3: ATOM: THE QUANTUM WORLD\nWeek 4: ATOM: THE QUANTUM WORLD\nWeek 5: CHEMICAL BONDS\nWeek 6: CHEMICAL BONDS\nWeek 7: CHEMICAL BONDS\nWeek 8: MOLECULAR SHAPE AND STRUCTURE\nWeek 9: MOLECULAR SHAPE AND STRUCTURE\nWeek 10: THE PROPERTIES OF GASES\nWeek 11: THE PROPERTIES OF GASES\nWeek 12: LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS\nWeek 13: LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS\nWeek 14: INORGANIC MATERIALS\nWeek 15: INORGANIC MATERIALS\nWeek 16: INORGANIC MATERIALS\nWeek 17: INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY\nWeek 18: ULTRAVIOLET AND VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY\n","scorePolicy":"(1) 期中考 : 40%\n(2) 期末考:  40%\n(3) 平時成績: 20%\n","materials":"Textbook : P.
