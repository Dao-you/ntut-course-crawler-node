The textbook is comprised of fourteen chapters with examples and problems and an answer section for selected problems.The chapters are mostly devoted to the geotechnical aspects of foundation design. Because the text introduces civil engineering students to the application of the fundamental concepts of foundation analysis and design, the mathematical derivations are not always presented. Instead, just the final form of the equation is given. Example problems that will help students understand the application of various equations and graphs are given in this class.","schedule":"1.
