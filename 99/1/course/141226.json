We will be using MATLAB to demonstrate and code up some of these concepts and applications along with some general tutorials on graphics and scientific visualization. Each student is encouraged to apply the scientific visualization techniques on his/her professional researches as a final report.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction to scientific visualization\nWeek 2: Basic structural dynamics using OpenSees - SDOF modeling\nWeek 3: Earthquake ground motion data\nWeek 4: Basic graphics and computer graphics primer\nWeek 5: Data representation of structural dynamics\nWeek 6: Finite element data representation and data structure\nWeek 7: Nonlinear structural dynamics using OpenSees\nWeek 8: Research topics on final reports\n---\nWeek 9: Midterm simulation\nWeek 10: Midterm\nWeek 11: Lighting and transparency\nWeek 12: Volume visualization\nWeek 13: Practices on dynamic structural analysis (1)\nWeek 14: Practices on dynamic structural analysis (2)\nWeek 15: Final report proposal presentations in English (1)\nWeek 16: Final report proposal presentations in English (2)\nWeek 17: Final report writing (1)\nWeek 18: Final report writing (2)\n--\n","scorePolicy":"Homework: 30%\nMidterm: 30%\nFinal presentation and report: 40%","materials":"1.
