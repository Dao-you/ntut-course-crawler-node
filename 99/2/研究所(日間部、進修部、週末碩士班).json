The cinema has established a tradition of feeding on works of literature as a source of cultural and aesthetic nourishment. But the results for her are \"disastrous to both.\" As she puts it, \"Eye and brain are torn asunder ruthlessly as they try vainly to work in couples.\" Although Woolf might have been over pessimistic about the alliance between works of literature and film adaptations, yet her words ring true at times. In this course, we will explore the limitations and shortcomings as well as the potentialities and strengths of the film adaptations of literary works.

We will also give an overview of where these areas can meet, and examine how a closer integration could be profitable.Part 1: Web Services: Overview, technologies, applicationsPart 2: Semantic Web: Overview, technologies, applicationsPart 3: Web Mining: Overview, technologies, applicationsPart 4: Integration issues: Semantic web services, Semantic web mining."},"id":"145347","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"服科所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=2&code=1427","code":"1427"}],"teacher":[{"name":"洪子逸","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=2&code=11432","code":"11432"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["5","6","7"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"六教726(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=2&code=451","code":"451"}],"people":"6","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=A107011","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=145347&code=11432"]},{"code":"6607003","name":{"zh":"科技英文表達","en":"Technical English Presentation"},"description":{"zh":"幫助學生認識一般科技文章以及科技論文語法、文體、句子結構等，並加強英文口頭表達之能力。","en":"This course helps the learners recognize the syntax, style, and organization as far as the papers on technology and technical writings are concerned.
