Project I involves writing an argumentative essay on educational or social issues.  Students will be guided with strategies of critical reading and reasoning so as to set forth critical responses and formulate solid arguments with sturdy evidences and strong reasoning. Project II—Reading the News—emphasizes analysis and critique.  After carefully examining two newspaper articles describing the similar event or issue, students will learn to read critically and write structured analysis essays.","schedule":"2/21　　What’s the Point of Arguing--“The Dead-End Kids”\n2/28　　228 Peace Memorial Day--Self-study:“Part-time Work Ethic”\n3/7　　Issue and Conclusion--“Balancing Act”\n3/14　　What Are the Reasons--Romance Is a Poor Basis for Marriage”\n3/21　　Evidence-- Draft 1 of Project I\n3/28　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n4/4　　How Good is the Evidence--2nd draft of Project I\n4/11　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n4/18　　Argumentative Essay--“Nonconformity Means Social Health”\nProject I finished\n4/25　　Comparison and Contrast--“Movie Gangsters and Westerners”\n5/2　　Reading the News--“The Committer vs. The Non-Committer”\n5/9　　Selecting a news event--“The Noose Incident”\n5/16　　Arguing Your Point of View--“An Appropriate Expression?”\nDraft 1 of Project 1I\n5/23　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n5/30　　Uses of Analysis--“Now Hip-Hop, Too, Is Made in China”\n“Why Isn’t Hip-Hop Popular in China”\n2nd draft of Project II\n6/6　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n6/13　　[Help],[Help],[Help]the Police!----Project II finished\n6/20　　Review and Discussion","scorePolicy":"Criteria for grading\n1.Project I: 35% (outline draft —10%; draft 2—10%; final draft: 15%)\n2.Project II: 35% (outline draft —10%; draft 2—10%; final draft: 15%)\n3.Assignments and In-class Practices: 30%","materials":"Requirements:\n1.Your regular attendance is required to pass this course.  3 unexcused absences from class will result failing grade for this course.
