Orthogonality and Inner-Product Spaces\nThis course Linear Algebra\n- is a mathematics course.\n- is useful and fundamental to EECS (and many other discipline) students.\n- emphasizes both computations and concepts.\n- asks you to use a popular matrix-based mathematical package called Matlab. （請使用計網中心電腦教室）\n- guides you to read through an English textbook.\n- requires hard work.\n","schedule":"Syllabus: (The number in parentheses indicates the estimated teaching hours.)\n(12) 1. Linear Equations\n- To understand the basic terminologies and notations of matrices and systems of linear equations, in the forms of vector equation and matrix equation.\n- Solving a system of linear equations with the Gaussian elimination: reducing a matrix to its echelon form.\n- To interpret a system of linear equations in various ways.\n- First exposure to key concepts such as linear independence and linear transformation.\n(8) 2. Matrix Algebra\n- To learn basic matrix arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication power, transpose, and inverse.\n- To summarize the concepts for systems of n linear equations in n unknowns.\n(12) 3. Vector Spaces\n- Introduction to vector spaces.\n- Fundamental subspaces of a matrix: column space, row space, and null space.\n- Basis and dimension of a vector space.\n(8) 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n- To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.\n- Diagonalization of a matrix (linear transformation).\n- To view eigenbases in the context of simplifying (decorrelating) linear transformations.\n(8) 5. Orthogonality and Inner-Product Spaces\n- To introduce inner product of vectors, and thus the geometric concepts of length, distance, and angle (perpendicularity).\n- To be familiar with the use of orthogonal bases.\n- Least-Squares approximation.\n","scorePolicy":"1.
