In addition, mold engineering is also recommended mold knowledge to any individuals, who need to understand mold in their activities. This course is divided into four sections: (1) Basics about Mold, Injection Machine, Plastics, and Products. (2) General Mold Design Guideline: mold layout, gate, runner, venting, ejection, mold cooling. (3) Specification of the Mold: mold parts and material, mold machining, strength and fatigue. (4) Mold Performance: mold life, cycle time, wall thickness, product size and shape.","schedule":"一. 課程介紹（3hrs）\n二. Introduction（3hrs）\n三. Mould making（3hrs）\n四.
