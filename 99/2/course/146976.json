Provide a basic understanding of vector analysis\nB. Learn to understand the fundamentals of solid mechanics\nC. Learn to understand mechanical properties of materials\nD. Learn to understand the stress-strain relationship and stress-strain transformation\n","schedule":"Course Outline:\n1.　　Statics\n1.1　　General Principles\n1.2　　Force Vectors\n1.3　　Force System Resultants\n1.4　　Equilibrium of a Rigid Body\n1.5　　Structural Analysis\n1.6　　Geometric Properties and Distributed Loadings\n1.7　　Internal Loadings\n2.　　Mechanics of Materials\n2.1　　Stress and Strain\n2.2　　Mechanical Properties of Materials\n2.3　　Axial Load\n2.4　　Torsion\n2.5　　Bending\n2.6　　Transverse Shear\n2.7　　Combined Loadings\n2.8　　Stress and Strain Transformation\n2.9　　Design of Beams\n2.10　　Buckling of Columns\n","scorePolicy":"Grades:\nGrades will be determined from a composite score of all graded materials, consisting of: two midterm exams, homework problems, and the comprehensive final exam. Weights used to determine the final score will be:\n1. Homework problems, 25%\n2. In-Class Activities, Quizzes 10%\n3. Two exams, 65% (midterm 30%, final 35%)\nHomework Rules:\n1.　　Homework problems are due at the beginning of class.\n2.　　Homework may be turned in 1 week late without excuse for up to 50% credit or the lowest grade of the class. You may look at the answer key in front of my office for guidance on late homework. Please work the homework early to avoid lateness due to computer crashes.\n3.　　Answer keys will be posted on http://elearning.ntut.edu.tw\n4.　　You may discuss with others how to begin working problems, but you must work the problem entirely yourself to hand in for credit. You may not share computer files for homework problems until the case study.\n5.　　Anyone who share computer files or copy homework from classmates will subject to a 50% off his/her homework credit.\nExams:\nAll exams will be held in our normal classroom.\nFinal Exam:\nAll students must take the final exam to pass the course. Finals will not be given at any other time. There will not be a make up exam.\n","materials":"Textbook:　　R. C.
