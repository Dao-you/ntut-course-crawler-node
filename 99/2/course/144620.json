Through this learning, the students can review the fundamental solid-state electronic devices and deeply dig into the modern semiconductor devices such as FinFETs with 5-nm and 3-nm gate lengths. After this study, the students are expected to equip the capability in characteristic analysis of nano-Si devices. In this course, the teaching topics include Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors, Motion and Recombination of Electrons and Holes,PN and Metal-Semiconductor Junctions, MOS Capacitor and MOS Field-effect Transistors, etc.","schedule":"Week　　Course Contents\n01　　Introduction\n02　　Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors\n03　　Motion and Recombination of Electrons and Holes\n04　　Device Fabrication Technology\n05　　PN and Metal-Semiconductor Junctions\n06　　PN and Metal-Semiconductor Junctions\n07　　MOS Capacitor\n08　　MOS Capacitor\n09　　Mid-term exam.\n10　　MOS Field-effect Transistors\n11　　MOS Field-effect Transistors\n12　　MOS Field-effect Transistors\n13　　MOSFET in ICs --- scaling, leakage, and other topics\n14　　MOSFET in ICs --- scaling, leakage, and other topics\n15　　MOSFET in ICs --- scaling, leakage, and other topics\n16　　Bipolar Junction Transistors\n17　　Bipolar Junction Transistors\n18　　Final exam\n","scorePolicy":"Grading:\n1.　　Midterm Exam.: 20%\n2.　　Final Exam: 30%\n3.　　Homework and quiz: 50%\n","materials":"Textbook: Modern Semiconductor Devices for Integrated Circuits by Chenming Calvin Hu, published by Prentice Hall, 2010\nReference:\n1.VLSI Technology by S.M.
