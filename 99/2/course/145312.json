The course will give a vision of a subsequent research career in design industry. Design industry is presented as a growing field of research within the design sciences and is positioned in its epistemological and scientific context. The various phases of the research process are presented, from formulation of a problem and a hypothesis, over planning and realization of an investigation to the treatment, presentation and interpretation of results. Introductions are given to information searching in scientific data bases, scientific authorship and writing of popular reports. A research report including an abstract is thereafter written in Chinese/English about a current project. Overall, The contents of this course will provide a comprehensive survey of qualitative and quantitative research methods and their method-specific hypothesis formulation, data acquisition, verification, and analysis. The training on the ability to speak and write effectively on subject matter is also contained in this course.\nCourse Objectives\n�X　　To increase the student’s understandings of the role of research in ”future design practice” and ”knowledge of the discipline for the benefit of society.”\n�X　　To increase the student's abilities to discover, critically read, interpret, and evaluate research.\n�X　　To increase the student's abilities to conduct design industry research.\n�X　　To increase the student's abilities to communicate research findings.\n�X　　To increase the student's understanding of research as an evidence-based design method\nProcedures and Class Sessions\nClasses will consist of lectures, moderated round-table discussions, the writing presentation of a research paper and a final exam. Classes will meet in classroom 603 on Friday evenings from 6:30 to 9:20 PM in the Autumn semester of 2010. Studying groups will be established, each consisting of 3-4 members. Each group is asked to build-up and maintains its own studying blog. This course offered out-of-class communications that consist mainly of e-mail communication, and responding to documents posted on the class discussion board as follows: http://www.facebook.com/imi.ntut\nResearch Paper\nThe Research Paper Presentations are considered formal presentations, and as such the dress and deportment of the speaker should be professional in all respects. The class will play the role of the academic review committee. The paper itself must also be of a professional quality such that it may stand on its own, not requiring a formal presentation.  The research paper should be edited by following the APA format (http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/apa/ in English or the document provided in Chinese). The Research Paper is structured approximately in six basic sections as: cover, abstract, contents, references, appendix and footnote. The contents should has subsection as: introduction, literature review, research methodology and design, case study or experiments, results discussion, conclusion and future work.\n","schedule":"Week 1　　Course Introduction\n\nWeek 2　　Course syllabus discussion;The IMDC research structure; Introduction of Endnotes and the APA format;About literature review and writing (I);Round Table Meeting Topic I: What is Interactive Media Design?\n\nWeek 3　　Interactive Session: Talking about your research (I);About literature review and writing (II);The research methods: assessment vs. evaluation;Round Table Meeting Topic II: What is a Research?\n\nWeek 4　　Interactive Session: Talking about your research (II);The quantitative research method (I);Round Table Meeting Topic III: The correlation betweenresearch and design\n\nWeek 5　　Group Presentation of  Round Table Meeting Topic I: The correlation between research and design;The quantitative research method (II);Report writing skill (I)\n\nWeek 6　　The quantitative research method (III);Report writing skill (II);Round Table Meeting Topic IV: The choice of research method\nfor Interactive Media Design\n\nWeek 7　　The qualitative research method (I);Report writing skill (III)\nRound Table Meeting Topic V: The choice of research method for creativeness industry\n\nWeek 8　　The qualitative research method (II);Report writing skill (III);Round Table Meeting Topic VI: The Research Schedule Arrangement\n\nWeek 9　　The qualitative research method (III);Report writing wrap-up and presentation\n\nWeek 10　　Final Exam,Course wrap-up\n","scorePolicy":"Course Requirements\nStudents are expected to fully participate in each class.
