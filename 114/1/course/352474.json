    "objective": "程式設計已成為各領域基礎且關鍵的能力之一，具備基本的程式能力，不僅能提升問題解決的邏輯思維能力，更是理解現代科技的入門門檻。本課程以 Python 為主要教學語言，從零開始，帶領學生學習變數、條件判斷、迴圈、函式、資料結構等基礎概念，並透過實作練習，加強學生對程式邏輯與結構的理解。此外，課程將安排簡介 AI 應用 的單元，讓學生了解如何運用基礎程式技巧操作簡單的人工智慧工具，啟發其對未來應用的興趣與想像。無論未來是否從事程式相關工作，本課程都將奠定學生跨領域運用數位能力的基礎。\nProgramming has become one of the most fundamental and essential skills across all fields. Having basic programming knowledge not only enhances logical thinking and problem-solving abilities, but also serves as an entry point to understanding modern technology. This course uses Python as the primary teaching language and starts from the ground up, guiding students through core concepts such as variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and data structures. Through hands-on exercises, students will strengthen their understanding of programming logic and structure. In addition, the course includes an introductory module on AI applications, allowing students to explore how basic programming skills can be used to operate simple artificial intelligence tools, sparking their interest and imagination for future applications. Regardless of whether students pursue a programming-related career, this course provides a solid foundation for applying digital skills across disciplines.",
