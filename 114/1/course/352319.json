    "objective": "This course aims to enhance students’ speaking skills with a particular focus on listening comprehension, critical analysis of certain issues, organization of ideas, and lucid delivery of a speech. The course is designed thematically and divided into 6 teaching sections. Each section contains two weeks. In the first week, we will approach a specific issue by watching an introductory video clip, doing listening exercises and understanding key terms. And then students will be divided into groups to discuss and present their opinions regarding the issue. In the second week, we will further explore the issue by watching selected scenes from a relevant film. Each group will be asked to answer critical questions by analyzing the scenes, formulate and organize their ideas, and deliver a short speech at the end of the class.",
