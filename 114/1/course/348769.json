    "objective": "This course focuses on understanding the algorithms behind programming solutions rather than the syntax of any specific programming language. Students will learn how to conceptualize, develop, and implement algorithms to solve engineering problems using a dual-language approach. Fortran will be used to introduce algorithmic fundamentals, while Python—generated and explored through ChatGPT—will demonstrate how logical structures can be adapted across languages.\n\nA key emphasis of this course is cultivating literacy in using Generative AI tools, especially ChatGPT, for programming. Students will learn how to prompt ChatGPT effectively, interpret and critique AI-generated code, and use it as a tool to accelerate their understanding of computational thinking. The course aims to empower students to confidently build adaptable, reliable solutions for engineering applications, especially those involving data analysis, simulation, and visualization.",
