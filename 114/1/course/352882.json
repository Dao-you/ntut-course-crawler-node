    "objective": "Course Description:\nThis course provides a hands-on introduction to practical optimization methodologies, with a strong emphasis on applying Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) techniques, particularly using ANSYS, to solve real-world engineering problems in design, analysis, and operations.\n\nStudents will explore optimization strategies for continuous-variable problems involving real-valued objective and constraint functions. The course focuses on the development of engineering intuition, along with technical proficiency in using optimization tools to tackle constrained design challenges.\n\nKey topics include:\n\n-Fundamentals of engineering optimization\n-Problem formulation and constraint handling\n-Integration of optimization algorithms with ANSYS\n-Case studies in mechanical and biomedical engineering\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to build and analyze practical optimization models using ANSYS, such as the optimal design of a dental implant under specific mechanical and anatomical constraints.",
