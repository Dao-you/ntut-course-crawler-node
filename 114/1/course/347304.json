Increasing lengths and difficulties of speeches of diverse topics also enables students to strengthen and apply more advanced analytical and synthetic skills. Students continue to brush up on skills obtained previously and in the second half, learn essential SI strategies, including paraphrasing or re-oralizing, split attention, multitasking, the time lag between interpreter and speaker, anticipation and reformulation.",
