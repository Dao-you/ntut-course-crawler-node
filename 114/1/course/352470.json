    "objective": "This course offers an in-depth introduction to Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), a powerful and flexible technique for analyzing complex relationships among observed and latent variables in applied research. The course is grounded in the use of the SEMinR package in R, providing students with a hands-on, code-based learning experience that emphasizes practical application over mathematical derivation. Throughout the semester, students will develop a strong conceptual and analytical foundation in PLS-SEM, beginning with the distinction between reflective and formative measurement models, and advancing through the evaluation of structural models and the interpretation of model outputs. Particular emphasis will be placed on the following topics: model specification, measurement validation, structural path estimation, bootstrapping for significance testing, predictive relevance assessment, and advanced modeling techniques such as mediation, moderation, and higher-order constructs.",
