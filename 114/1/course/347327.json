    "objective": "This course contains the basic theories in probability and random processes. It includes probability measures, random variables, the law of large number, statistical inference, random processes and stationary processes. This course offers substantial probabilistic and statistical backgrounds for the machine learning (ML) field and serves as a basic course in field of communications, networks and controls in graduate school.",
