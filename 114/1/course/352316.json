    "objective": "本課程強調全方位的國際商用英語溝通。現今各領域上之商業活動多以英語進行，因此本課程注重發展學生以英語文進行流暢之溝通的關鍵能力，特別強調商業組織內外部常見的正式溝通之形式，包括商用英語寫作、簡報與會議技巧。課時也納入非正式溝通技巧，指導學生學習應對職場情境，因應相關之溝通需求。\nThis current course emphasizes a holistic view of business communication in a global context.  Given that business communication across from fields of business activities is now made possible by the English language, the course thus aims to develop the ability to use critical skills essential to successful communication in English, with particular emphases on forms of formal communications that are highly visible within and outside business organizations, including writing of business correspondence and reports, presentations and meetings. Informal communication skills are also incorporated to address workplace situations to identify the relevant communication needs.",
