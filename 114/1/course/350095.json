    "objective": "本課程主要探討非線性系統與線性系統之間的不同，並介紹 Lyapunov stability 及其相關觀念。除此之外，將介紹如何利用各種穩定性分析的觀念及各種方法探討非線性系統的穩定性，最後並介紹如何設計控制器使非線性系統穩定。\nThis course mainly explores the different between the nonlinear system and linear system, and introduces the concept Lyapunov stability. Besides, one wants to introduce how to utilize the concept and method of stability analysis to explore the stability of nonlinear system. Finally, the designs of nonlinear controllers are introduced to stabilize the nonlinear systems.",
