    "objective": "This course is designed to:\n(1) strengthen students' previously acquired knowledge of English by reviewing fundamental grammatical concepts and sentence structures through level-appropriate reading materials;\n(2) develop reading skills through explanation of challenging vocabulary, phrases, and syntax, along with the analysis of fundamental writing techniques;\n(3) familiarize students with practical conversational expressions and enhance their confidence in cross-cultural communication; and\n(4) reinforce their competence and performance in listening, speaking, reading, and writing through consistent practice.\n\nIn addition, the course incorporates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support language learning. Students will explore how AI-assisted platforms—such as grammar checkers, pronunciation analyzers, conversation simulators, and personalized vocabulary trainers—can be used to enhance autonomous learning, provide real-time feedback, and improve overall language proficiency.\n\n本課程旨在：\n\n(1) 鞏固學生既有的英語知識，透過符合其程度的閱讀教材，複習基本語法概念與句型結構；\n(2) 發展閱讀能力，透過講解困難詞彙、片語與句法結構，並分析基礎寫作技巧，以提升理解與寫作表達；\n(3) 使學生熟悉實用的會話用語，並增強其跨文化溝通的自信心；\n(4) 透過反覆練習，加強聽、說、讀、寫四項語言技能的能力與表現。\n\n此外，課程亦納入人工智慧（AI）工具於語言學習中的應用。學生將學習如何運用各類 AI 輔助平台 —— 如文法檢查器、發音分析工具、模擬對話系統，以及個人化詞彙學習軟體 —— 以提升自主學習成效，獲得即時回饋，並全面增進語言能力。",
