    "objective": "This course provides an in-depth study of digital signal processing (DSP) principles and techniques. Some ideas are built using MATLAB codes. Topics include discrete-time signals and systems, Fourier analysis, Z-transform, filter design and implementation, sampling rate conversion, random signal processing, and spectral analysis. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical applications through assignments, projects, and research paper studies. By the end of this course, students will be able to:\n1. Analyze and process discrete-time signals and systems.\n2. Apply the Fourier and Z-transform techniques to signal analysis.\n3. Design and implement FIR and IIR digital filters.\n4. Perform spectral analysis and sampling rate conversion.\n5. Critically review and present recent research papers in DSP.\n6. Complete a comprehensive final project demonstrating mastery of course concepts.",
