    "objective": "This course will acquaint students with fundamental concepts and principles of professional translation. Students will acquire a solid grounding in a range of ideas within translation studies (e.g. linguistic and functionalist approaches, discourse and register analysis, translation norms, cultural turn, sociology of translation, and translation technologies) and apply the theoretical knowledge to various English and Chinese translation activities. This course will also enable students to critically discuss the basic postulates of translation theories and use them in text analysis, the identification of translation problems, and the formulation of suitable strategies and techniques.",
