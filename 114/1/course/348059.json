    "objective": "This course is designed to develop students' ability to critically analyze and evaluate ethical issues in contemporary business settings, with a strong emphasis on real-world case learning. Through the study of current and high-profile corporate cases (such as Theranos, Volkswagen, Amazon, and Starbucks), students will learn to identify ethical dilemmas, apply key ethical principles, and use structured decision-making frameworks to propose responsible solutions. Topics include integrity, transparency, fairness, accountability, labor rights, environmental responsibility, AI ethics, and corporate social responsibility. The course encourages students to consider multiple stakeholder perspectives and reflect on moral conflicts through case-based discussions and role-play. In addition, students will be guided to use AI tools responsibly for research and idea generation while upholding academic integrity and digital ethics. By the end of the course, students will have developed a practical understanding of ethical leadership and be able to apply ethical reasoning in both professional and civic contexts.",
