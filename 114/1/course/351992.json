    "objective": "本課程主旨在介紹計算生物學及醫學資訊學相關之重要主題，目的在於提供學生漸進式的介紹，理解當代最新之各項生醫分析技術。本課程主要為有志於跨領域學習之學生所設計，內容包含基礎生物學的核心知識與基礎 Linux 操作，以及生醫領域的序列比對工具和介紹微陣列晶片技術。在奠定基礎後開始進入次世代分析技術的應用，主題將包含 DNA 定序、RNA 定序與總體基因體學分析。希望透過這些內容讓學生在分析各種基因資料並了解不同生物學問題時，具備選擇合適工具與詮釋結果的能力。接著，透過研究實例和分析操作，讓學生接觸到實際實驗測量產生的數據，體會真實研究的過程。藉由實際操作相關分析工具，使學生體會基因資料在實務上的重要性，達到將生物理論與實務應用緊密結合的目標。此外，課程也將邀請計算生物學領域的專家親臨授課，透過專題演講與實作操作，帶領學生深入探索前沿技術，拓展知識與實做技能。\nThis course aims to introduce important topics related to computational biology and medical informatics. The objective is to provide students with a gradual introduction to understanding the latest contemporary biomedical analysis techniques. This course is primarily designed for students interested in interdisciplinary learning. The content includes concept knowledge of basic biology, fundamental Linux operations, sequencing alignment in the biomedical field, and introductions to microarray technologies. After establishing this foundation, the course will progress to the application of next-generation sequencing technology, covering topics such as DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and metagenomics analysis. Through this content, students will develop the ability to select appropriate tools and interpret results when analyzing various types of genetic data and addressing different biological questions. Following this, research case studies and hands-on analytical exercises will allow students to engage with real data generated from experimental measurements, providing insight into the actual research process. By directly working with relevant analytical tools, students will gain an appreciation for the practical significance of genetic data, achieving the goal of closely integrating biological theory with real-world applications. In addition, the course will feature guest lectures and hands-on workshops by experts in computational biology, guiding students in exploring cutting-edge technologies and expanding both their theoretical knowledge and practical skills.",
