    "objective": "本校之普通物理課程專為工程科系背景之同學設計，主要的目的是鼓勵同學參與大自然運行奧秘、法則之探索，並供給爾後修習專業課程之堅實基礎。本課程之內容包含力學、熱力學、聲學、電磁學、光學及近代物理。教授者可按每週三小時、二個學期的時間設計、再參酌各系不同之需求、加強或節略某些章節。\nThe course is aimed directly at the students with engineering background. The theme of this course is to encourage students to participate in the discovery of laws and wonder of nature. And to solidate the foundation for the particular courses of study for different departments. The contents of this course include mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, optics, and foundation of modern physics, etc.. The lecturers will design this course under deliberating the differences of each departments to emphasize or to omit some contents. The course is designed for 6 credits for two semesters; 3 credits for each semester,  and 3 lecture hours per week.",
