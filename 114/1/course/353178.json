    "objective": "This course introduces students to the core concepts and methods of statistics, with a focus on\nlearning how to use data effectively in the face of uncertainty. Key topics include data\nvisualization, descriptive statistics, probability, statistical inference, and linear regression.\nEmphasis will be placed on building intuition and practical understanding rather than mathematical\nrigor.\nStudents will develop the skills to make sense of data, draw meaningful conclusions, and\ncommunicate results with clarity and confidence. The tools and thinking developed in this course\nare valuable for making informed decisions and conducting research across a wide range of\ndisciplines. They also form the foundation of many modern applications, including data science,\nmachine learning, and artificial intelligence.\nRequirements and Expectations\nThis is an English-medium course. English must be used at all times in class, including for\nhomework, quizzes, exams, and all other course-related work.\nWe will use NTU COOL to share course materials and announcements. You are expected to\ncheck both NTU COOL and your school email daily to stay informed and up to date.\nAll cell phones and other communication devices should be turned off or silenced during class.\nStudents may be cold-called to answer questions. Active and voluntary participation in discussions\nis highly encouraged",
