    "objective": "Course Title: Finite Element Analysis (有限元素分析)\nThis course introduces the basic principles of the finite element method and its applications in various engineering problems. Topics include fundamental concepts of finite element analysis, establishing finite element models using variational principles, shape functions, and iso-parametric elements. It covers one-dimensional problems such as rods, trusses, beams, and frames; two-dimensional problems including plane stress, plane strain, and plate-shell problems; and three-dimensional problems involving general solids. Practical exercises and case studies using finite element analysis software are included for practice and research analysis.\nThis semester, the course integrates USR (University Social Responsibility) into the curriculum, guiding students to apply finite element analysis to the USR project. Students who heavily participate in the USR project can utilize finite analysis in their USR electrical vehicle designs and/or for systematic improvements.",

All homework should be submitted through the e-learning platform. No late homework will be accepted except having approved absences. The project report is due the day of the oral presentation. 5 points would be subtracted per each single day delay. Delaying for 5 days or more would get 0 points.\n7.\tCopy and cheating are not allowed. If one is found copy and cheating, 0 points would be given for the event.\n8.\tPlease set your phone to silent or vibration mode while in class; otherwise, 5 points will be deducted from the semester score and treated as one absence for each violation.\n9.\tAttendance check will be done every week.
