    "objective": "The primary goal of this course is to equip students with foundational 3D modeling and rendering skills, while guiding them through the complete process of transforming a design concept into a tangible output. The course will focus on Rhino 3D, a widely used tool in both fabrication and industrial design. Through a series of tutorials and hands-on exercises, students will develop a solid understanding of the software and gain essential skills applicable to various design industries.\n\nBy the end of the semester, each student is expected to complete a comprehensive Graphic Doding project, which must include codes, renderings, animations, and a 3D model. This final package will serve as the key evaluation criteria for the course.\n\nIn addition, we will dedicate part of the class to introducing digital fabrication workflows, providing students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with turning digital models into physical objects.",
