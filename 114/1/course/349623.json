    "objective": "FUEL CELLS are an important component in Energy Engineering and can be defined as an electrochemical system that converts chemical energy in the fuel into electrical energy with the help of electrodes and redox electrochemical. There are many kinds of fuel cells that help us in meeting the energy demands of this modernizing world. Understanding them theoretically is very significant for research advancements in the field of Energy. \nThis course ' FUEL CELLS’ is a basic course taught entirely in English. \nThe aim of this course is to provide introductory knowledge to students about the basics, types, working mechanism, applications and advancements in the field of fuel cells.\nThis class will also deal with sustainable fuel cells for producing clean energy and thereby preventing hazardous environmental issues through significant energy efficiency improvements and sustainable use of resources.\nThis course enables students to fully understand the basics of professional disciplines of the fuel cell, and to further inspire and enhance the knowledge of students about future energy technology. \nThis course also has an important objective of motivating non-native English students to improve their English language skills like conversing, discussing and writing assignments in English.\nThese practices will help them deliver better English presentations and also enhance their thesis and paper writing abilities.",
