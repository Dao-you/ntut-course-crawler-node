    "objective": "以傳授設計原理、平面及立體設計觀念、美的形式原理、平面及立體的構成練習、對各種材料特性的應用經驗以及造形與色彩的研究達到設計感覺的養成並提高計畫性創造能力，是發展實用性及機能性以前之設計訓練的基礎。\nThis course aims to develop the ability of students to meet specific sensory needs through the creation of abstract visual order in the form of two-dimension and three-dimension. The visual organization of design elements including line, plane, volume, and the analysis of their abstract relationships and principles of order are studied.",
