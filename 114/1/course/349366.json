    "objective": "Statistical design of experiments is a wide subject that treats a large number of methods for planning experimental investigations in a manner that ensures statistically valid conclusions. This course introduces students to concepts and techniques of classical and applied experimental design and covers the statistical design of experiments for systematically examining how a system functions. Topics covered will include: introduction to fundamentals and principles of experiments, blocking designs, completely randomized designs (CRD), randomized completely block designs (RCBD), full factorial designs with two levels, fractional designs with two levels, Latin square designs, 3-leval designs (CCD, BBD, Cuboidal designs), and response surface methodologies.",
