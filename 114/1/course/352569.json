    "objective": "This course will teach the fundamentals for packaging, including phase diagrams of solders, bonding technology, metallurgical reactions, and reliabilities, as well as the state-of-the-art Cu-Cu hybrid bonding. It will also cover bonding technology of microelectronic packaging: Die Attach/Chip Bond, Wire Bond, Tape automatic bonding, Flip Chip Technology, Pb-based and Pb-free Solders, Microbumps, 3D IC packaging, Cu-Cu bonding, and Cu hybrid bonding. \nMetallurgical reactions include Cu-Sn, Ni-Sn, Sn-Au, Ag-Sn, Pd-Sn, and In-Sn. The following reliability issues will be taught: multiple reflow, electromigration, thermomigration, Stress, temperature cycling tests, solid state aging, Sn whisker, and Mean-time-to-failure measurement.",
