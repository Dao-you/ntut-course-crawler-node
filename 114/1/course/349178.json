    "objective": "Principle of Interaction Design: Autumn 2024 - Syllabus\nCredit Hours: 2.0\nInstructors: Ryan Sheng-Ming Wang\n\n\nCourse Description: \n\"Interaction Design\" blends theoretical and practical perspectives in the areas of visualization and interactivity into several focused aspects using interactivity for education, entertainment, interactive media design and industrial design purposes. \nAn interface is the link between a user and a design that communicates how a design will be used, creating an experience for the people who will use it. It provides the framework, elements, and resources for a “conversation” to take place between users and design.\n In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of interfaces and the interaction design process. Students will be introduced to and have opportunity to practice the fundamental concepts, methods, and practices of interaction design. They will explore the ideas of \"User Experience Observation \", \"Form Follows Function\" and \"User Interaction Analysis and Evaluation\". They will explore how interactive media create experiences, and understand the role that interaction with contents and installment fulfills in human existence. Finally and most importantly, students need to learn how to improve their ability to present their design ideas.\nThis is a class with time devoted to lecture, discussion, practice activities, design work sessions, and critique of practical work. \n\n\nCourse Objectives/Goals: \nAt the conclusion of the course, students will be able to: \n1.\tIdentify how increasingly complex technologies are integrated into designs, services and events. \n2.\tDefine how digital or physical artifacts behave in response to user-centric interaction. \n3.\tDescribe, test and evaluate the usability and sustainability of user interfaces. \n4.\tApply iterative cycles of research, testing and development based on the understanding of user needs, goals and experiences. \n5.\tDevelop solutions and processes to common or known interface problems. \n6.\tBuild and test rapid prototypes for look and feel and usability. \n7.\tUtilize client based concept development to develop the strategy, information architecture, human-computer interaction and interface design. \n8.\tDemonstrate competency in information architecture, human-computer interaction and interface design.",
