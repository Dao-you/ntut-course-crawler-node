    "objective": "在當代營建產業中，項目日益複雜且數據量龐大，傳統管理方法已難以應對高效率、低成本和永續發展的需求。計算智慧作為人工智慧的重要分支，能有效處理不確定性、非線性和高維度問題，為營建管理帶來突破性變革。本課程系統性介紹計算智慧技術（涵蓋機器學習、深度學習、模糊系統、進化計算等）如何應用於營建管理各環節。本課程旨在培養同學理解各類演算法的基本原理與適用場景，並透過專案練習及軟體操作讓同學具備計算智慧技術的應用能力。\nIn today's construction industry, projects are becoming increasingly complex with massive volumes of data, making traditional management approaches inadequate to meet the demands for high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainable development. Computational intelligence, as a crucial branch of artificial intelligence, can effectively address uncertainties, nonlinearities, and high-dimensional problems, bringing transformative changes to construction management. This course systematically introduces how computational intelligence technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, and more, can be applied across various aspects of construction management. The course aims to equip students with an understanding of the fundamental principles and practical applications of multiple algorithms while also developing their skills in applying computational intelligence techniques through hands-on projects and software implementation.",
