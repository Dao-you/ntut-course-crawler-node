    "objective": "Construction history could be considered as the key foundation to understand architectonic theories. Conventionally, architectural academies provide study aspects either in architectural histories in terms of development of architectural style and philosophy or in the latest progress of architectural materials and construction techniques. Moreover, theoretical debates of architecture also pay more attentions to philosophical discussions instead of physical construction presentation.\nNevertheless, architectonic theories mainly discuss the presentation of materials and construction systems. Therefore, construction methods of materials in fact affect the interpretation of architectonic theories significantly. As a result, this course can be divided into two sections: firstly the construction history of Eastern and Western worlds as well as modern period of time will be reviewed. Secondly the architectonic and relative theoretic debates will be discussed. The purpose of the course is to d",

    "scorePolicy": "＊＊Attendance 20%\n＊＊Participation 30%\nEach participant needs to study a required article in advance and brief the article for all participants in the class of the required day for 20 minutes.\n  (Week 4) Frampton’s chapter 1 (____)\n  (Week 6) Semper’s four elements  (____)\n  (Week 8) Frampton’s chapter 7 (____)\n  (Week 11) Adam’s house (____)\n  (Week 13) Loos’s principle of dressing (____)\n  (Week 16) Venturi’s texts (____)\n  (Week 17) skeuomorph (____)\t\n＊＊Mid-term presentation: proposal for the final report 20%\nIn the first half of the courses, each participant has to find a project with vivid material expressions, which can be discussed in terms of tectonic theories and interpretations. The project can be international or domestic. It should be easier if the participant might find its design drawings. Students should present their plans of their final reports in the mid-term class about 10 minutes, in order to collect some feedback from colleagues and class instructor for further develop to achieve the final report.\n＊＊Research thesis 30%\nOne should submit his/her thesis by the noon of 1/21 (12:00pm) to Dr. Wu in person. The words of the thesis should not be less than 5000 words. It should be in thesis format (word) instead of brief presentation format (power point).\nEmployed materials of one’s chosen architectural project for the thesis should be clarified. Please note that the referred theories should be reviewed firstly. Aftermath, the discussion of material deployment should be referred to at least one of the architectonic or atectonic theories.",
