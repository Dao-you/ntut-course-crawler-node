    "objective": "The overall objective of this course is to introduce the types and functions of geosynthetics, along with their engineering applications. Specifically, the course focuses on soil reinforcement and provides students with the fundamental knowledge and analytical tools necessary for the design, analysis, and performance evaluation of geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) structures, including both walls and slopes. The course also covers topics such as construction, monitoring, maintenance, case histories, and the current state-of-the-art applications of GRS structures in mitigating various natural disasters.",
