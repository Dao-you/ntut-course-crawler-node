    "objective": "This course aims to explore how media influence our lives, culture, and social structures, while guiding students to reflect on their own roles within the media environment. \nThe course is divided into four major sections, moving from the external to the internal dimensions of media—beginning with media consumption, then moving through media texts, and finally media production—to gradually build an understanding of how media operate.\nWe will start by examining the role of the audience: how individuals consume, engage with, or even resist media. Next, we will analyze media texts—including, but not limited to, television, film, advertising, and magazines—to investigate how they “represent” (or distort) different aspects of our lives. We will then turn to the operations of media industries, considering how underlying economic and political structures shape media content. Finally, the course will extend to today’s new media landscape, focusing on the transformations and challenges brought about in the digital age.\nBy integrating theory with case studies, this course encourages students to critically view, analyze, and engage with contemporary media culture, cultivating both media sensitivity and media literacy.",
