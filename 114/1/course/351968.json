    "objective": "This course focus on investigating the strength and deformability of jointed rock mass from analyzing the mechanical behavior of intact rock and discontinuities. Related issues for rock engineering such as numerical analysis, in-situ stress, rock hydraulics, and rock classification will be introduced, to help students understand the theory and the application of rock mechanics.",
