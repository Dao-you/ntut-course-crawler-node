    "objective": "This course offers an in-depth exploration into the analysis and design of mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs), with a particular emphasis on signal conversion and system modeling. The curriculum is structured around four main pillars (MLDS) : (1) Modeling - the development of mixed-signal circuits, (2) Language - proficiency in programming languages such as Verilog-A, Verilog-D, Python, C, and Matlab, (3) Data/Signal - thorough analysis of circuit performance and signal quality, and (4) System - mastery in adaptive optimization algorithms. Practical examples, including voltage regulators, Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs), and Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), will be used to reinforce learning.",
