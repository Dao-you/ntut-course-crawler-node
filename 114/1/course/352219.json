    "objective": "The goal of this course is to give students a broad overview of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, and teach students how to develop deep learning applications by hands-on coding examples. Most examples taught in this class are based on the TensorFlow framework. We will cover many different fields including image classification, object detection, natural language processing, reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks.",
