    "objective": "The progress of electronic industry accelerates the computer development so that computer simulation becomes one of the important tool in many fields. In this course, we will discuss how to apply the computer to assist the molecular structure design. In order to gain insight into the basic idea of structural design, the fundamental background in molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and quantum chemistry will be introduced. Some practical softwares will also be included in the course.  Each student has to prepare his personal notebook for practice each lecture.",
