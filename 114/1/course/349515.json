    "objective": "本課程為碩士班結構材料組一年級的核心選修課程。本課程內容著重在了解結構動力學基本原理與分析方法。以大學部的靜力學、材料力學、結構學等相關課程為基礎，進一步了解結構物在受具有時間特性的動態載重下引發的動態反應。本學期課程內容可大致分為：運動方程式、自由振動、強制振動、數值分析方法、反應譜分析、多自由度系統分析、阻尼特性、頻率域分析簡介等。\nThis course is a core elective designed for first-year graduate students in the Structural Materials division of the Master’s program. The course focuses on the fundamental principles and analytical methods of structural dynamics. Building upon undergraduate-level courses such as statics, mechanics of materials, and structural analysis, students will further explore the dynamic responses of structures subjected to time-dependent loads. The main topics covered during the semester include: Equations of motion, Free vibration, Forced vibration, Numerical analysis methods, Response spectrum analysis, Multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system analysis, Damping characteristics, and Introduction to frequency domain analysis.",
