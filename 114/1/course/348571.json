    "objective": "This course aims to guide students in understanding the role of archives in the preservation, exhibition, and value-added application of cultural materials. Starting with the fundamental concepts of archives, the course explores how curatorial methods and innovative value-adding strategies can transform historical texts into cultural content with contemporary relevance and market potential. Through the integration of domestic and international case studies, topics will cover institutional archives, community memory, digital translation, and brand licensing. Students will engage in group discussions, project-based assignments, and site visits to learn how to navigate the entire process—from data analysis and curatorial concept development to creative value-added production—while cultivating interdisciplinary practical skills and creative thinking.",
