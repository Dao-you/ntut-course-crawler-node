    "objective": "Course Title: Numerical Analysis with MATLAB\n\nCourse Objectives:\nThis course introduces students to the fundamentals and applications of numerical methods to solve various engineering and scientific problems. By the end of the course, students will understand how to formulate mathematical models, analyze errors, solve nonlinear equations, perform matrix-based solutions of linear systems, apply curve fitting and interpolation techniques, and solve differential equations numerically. The course emphasizes practical MATLAB implementation, encouraging students to develop, test, and interpret numerical algorithms and simulations. Emphasis will also be placed on the methods' efficiency, stability, and accuracy. The course prepares students to be competent problem-solvers in real-world situations where analytical solutions are infeasible.\n\nTeaching Methods:\nThe course employs a combination of lectures, hands-on MATLAB tutorials, problem-solving sessions, and project-based learning. Weekly lectures introduce theoretical foundations and derivations of algorithms, reinforced with illustrative engineering applications. Students will engage in weekly computer labs to implement and test methods in MATLAB, using provided templates or writing their scripts. Regular homework and in-class problem sets enhance analytical thinking and programming proficiency. Open discussions, collaborative projects, and quizzes provide formative feedback, while a final project allows for creative exploration of numerical methods in student-selected topics. Using graphical visualizations and case studies ensures connection to real-world phenomena, fostering theoretical understanding and practical competency.",
