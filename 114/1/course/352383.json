    "objective": "本課程在讓學生全面了解技術紡織品及其在各行業的專業應用。課程首先介紹該領域，然後探討高性能纖維及其結構和功能特性，然後深入研究紡織增強複合材料及其機械優勢。它還涵蓋了過濾、土工布、防護裝備、醫用紡織品和汽車用途等關鍵應用領域。透過講座和案例討論，學生將深入了解材料選擇、設計考慮和性能評估。課程以學生主導的口頭陳述結束，培養有效傳達技術內容的能力。\nThis course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of technical textiles and their specialized applications across various industries. Beginning with an introduction to the field, the course explores high-performance fibers and their structural and functional characteristics, followed by an in-depth examination of textile-reinforced composites and their mechanical advantages. It further covers key application areas such as filtration, geotextiles, protective gear, medical textiles, and automotive uses. Through lectures and case discussions, students will gain insights into material selection, design considerations, and performance evaluation. The course culminates in student-led oral presentations, fostering the ability to communicate technical content effectively.",
