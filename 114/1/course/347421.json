    "objective": "The purpose of this course is to train students to independently plan, analyze, evaluate, summarize, and think creatively through the use of project design. Through an in-depth exploration of life styles, current trends, and technological developments, students will practice the process of project design and become familiar with the knowledge and techniques of integrating design and technology. In this program, students work in groups to complete an integrated media design theme, and finally present their work in both on-campus and off-campus public exhibitions.",
