    "objective": "This course provides a comprehensive study of convective heat transfer, focusing on the fundamentals of fluid flow, energy transport, and boundary layer theory. Both forced and natural convection are examined in detail, with emphasis on governing equations, similarity analysis, and engineering correlations. Applications to internal and external flows are highlighted to prepare students for solving real-world thermal problems.",
