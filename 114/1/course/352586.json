    "objective": "Because many people play, watch, and discuss sports everyday, being able to talk about sports and to understand sports idioms is very helpful when interacting with English speakers. This course introduces students to English vocabulary that is useful for talking about sports, but also useful in other social situations.  (For example, many sports idioms -- such as “to play hardball” and “to strike out” -- are used by businessmen in professional situations not directly related to sports).  The class helps students to understand more clearly English news about sports, to talk more thoughtfully with English speakers about sports, and to think more critically about the important role that sports play in the culture, language, and everyday life of people in the English-speaking world.\n\n因為很多人每天都會參與、觀看和討論體育運動，所以在與英語使用者溝通時，能夠談論體育運動和理解體育習語是非常有幫助的。本課程向學生介紹不僅在談論體育運動時有用的英語詞彙，而且在其他社交場合也很有用。  （例如，許多體育習語 —— 如 “打硬球” 和 “三振出局”—— 被商人用於與體育無直接關係的專業場合）。  該課程幫助學生更清楚地了解有關體育的英語新聞，與英語使用者更深思熟慮地談論體育，並更批判地思考體育在英語世界人們的文化、語言和日常生活中發揮的重要作用。",
