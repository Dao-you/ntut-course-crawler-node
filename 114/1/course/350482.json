    "objective": "This course will explore the possibilities and developments of using interactive technology in contemporary performing arts and installation design. It will introduce forms and aesthetics of interactive performance, computer vision and listening, real-time video processing, and real-time audio synthesis. Through proposing and executing actual performance projects and interdisciplinary collaboration, students will have the opportunity to integrate interactive technology, interactive installations, and performing arts. The course will emphasize project proposal and conceptualization, performance scripting, stage and interactive installation design, and interactive audio-visual application design.\n\n本課程將探討互動科技運用於當代表演藝術、裝置設計之可能性與相關發展，並介紹互動表演形式與美學、電腦視覺與電腦聆聽、即時影像處理、即時音訊合成等，藉由實際展演計畫之提案與執行，透過跨領域合作，讓學生有機會將互動科技、互動裝置、表演藝術三者結合。本課程將注重展演計畫之提案與發想、表演之腳本安排、舞台與互動裝置設計、互動影音應用設計等。",
