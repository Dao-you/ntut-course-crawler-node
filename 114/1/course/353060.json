    "objective": "Through weekly readings and class discussion, this course will help develop students’ English conversation and reading skills.  In the course of practicing such skills, we will focus on an idea central to understanding the language and the culture of the West, and thus an idea central to understanding the people (their values, motivations, principles) of Western culture.   [Past topics for this course include: Monsters and the Human; Comedy and Humor; The Nature of Good and Evil; The Hero in the West; Baseball and Society; The Idea and the Importance of Beauty; Exploration and Discovery].   Examining essays and films centered around such a topic, we will consider what the significant idea tells us about Western society and its people.\n\n透過每週閱讀和課堂討論，本課程將幫助培養學生的英語會話和閱讀能力。  在練習這些技能的過程中，我們將集中在理解西方語言和文化的核心思想，從而理解西方文化中的人們（他們的價值觀、動機和原則）的核心思想。   [本課程的過去主題包括：怪物與人類；喜劇與幽默；善與惡的本質；西方英雄；棒球與社會；美的概念與重要性；探索與發現。   透過研究圍繞這一主題的文章和電影，我們將思考這個重要想法如何告訴我們有關西方社會及其人民的資訊。",
