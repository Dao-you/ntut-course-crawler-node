    "objective": "This course is one of the fundamental courses in the thermofluid sciences for graduate students. Based upon the concept of conservation, the equations of mass, momentum, and energy will be derived. This course will deal with solutions of these equations, both exact and approximate. The application of solutions includes irrotational flow, low Reynolds number flow, and high Reynolds number (boundary layer) flow, etc.",
