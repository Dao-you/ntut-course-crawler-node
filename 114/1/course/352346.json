    "objective": "This course integrates foundational training in object-oriented programming with practical applications relevant to smart living technologies (Course No. 350096).  \nStudents will develop essential programming skills through exercises and projects, with a strong emphasis on OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. In addition to foundational OOP topics, the course explores real-world applications, including recent advancements in vision-language models and their integration into autonomous driving systems. \nStudents will engage in critical reading and discussion of cutting-edge research papers to understand how OOP techniques support complex AI systems.\nSome parts of the course will be co-taught by a doctoral teaching assistant providing additional support and insights into advanced topics.",
