    "objective": "This is a one-semester graduate course on electromagnetic theory. \n\nThe course slides are divided into four units:\n- Chapter 1: Maxwell Equations\n- Chapter 2: Propagation and Transmission\n- Chapter 3: Radiation\n- Chapter 4: Scattering\n\nMathematical tools are introduced as needed throughout the course.",
    "schedule": "Week 1-3: Chapter 1\nWeek 4: Presentation 1\nWeek 5-7: Chapter 2\nWeek 8: Presentation 2\nWeek 9-11: Chapter 3\nWeek 12: Presentation 3\nWeek 13-15: Chapter 4\nWeek 16: Presentation 4\nWeek 17-18: Review",
    "scorePolicy": "This course includes four required presentations (each 25%). The first is a proposal outlining the final project topic, the second and third serve as progress updates, and the fourth is the final project presentation. Each presentation begins with a base score of 70 points. If a student does not have a project topic, they may instead present a recent (within five years) research paper. Additional points—up to 10 each—are awarded for (1) speech clarity, (2) slide quality, and (3) content completeness. These aspects are evaluated by the instructor. \n\nNo tests are required in this course. However, if a student is unable to give a presentation (excluding the final presentation), they may substitute it with a written test. This option is allowed at most twice during the semester.",
