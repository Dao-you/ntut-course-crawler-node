    "objective": "Advanced robotic manipulation is offered to graduate students interested in learning issues in design and analysis of robotics.  In addition to lectures on advances in robotic manipulation and/or mobile robotics, oral presentations and reports on robotics research papers are required.  Main topics in the course are as follow.\n\n1. Spatial descriptions, transformations, and representations for orientation   2. Manipulator kinematics  3. Manipulator inverse kinematics  4. Jacobians: velocities and static forces  5. Manipulator dynamics   6. Trajectory generation and manipulator design 7. EKF-SLAM  8. Advances in manipulators and mobile robotics  9. Paper presentations and reports",
