What is the purpose of popular culture? What differentiates music, art, and literature that become popular among the masses from works that do not? Who decides what popular culture is, and who decides what high culture is? We will pay particular attention to the ways in which popular culture becomes high culture and vice versa. We will analyze how similar stories recur across various time periods and geographic regions, how modernity affects our view of culture and art, and how stories change when told in different genres. Students will make presentations about aspects of popular culture that interest them, will participate in in-class writing, quizzes, and exams, and will write two formal reflection papers.","schedule":"This syllabus is simplified.
