In-class activities+ Quizzes: 30%","materials":"Requirements:\n1.Regular attendance is required to pass this course.  3 unexcused absences from class will result in failing this course.  One unexcused absence will result in an automatic final score reduction of 2 points.  \n\n2. Students will be given quizzes, announced or unannounced, on the reading texts. In-class group discussions and writing will be included to develop students’ critical thinking skills. If you miss any of the quizzes or fail to finish the group activity by the end of the class, there is no way to make it up (no exceptions).  However, your two lowest scores will be dropped—so, save these for those unexpected occasions when you might be sick or miss class for other reasons.\n\n3. Selections of the supplementary readings are designed as a self-study reading assignment. The whole class will be divided into 8 groups with 3 students in each group.  Every week, 1-2 groups will be well-prepared for oral presentation on the assigned reading. The task for each group-member includes (1) a brief summary of the section assigned; (2) a review on selected words and expressions; (3) comments or reflections on significant passages or sentences; (4) questions for classmates.\n\n4. Each student should keep a Reading Portfolio on the supplementary readings. Your reading portfolio includes at least 6 Summary entries and 12 pages of Handwritten Notes on useful expressions or your reflection on any of the passages encountered while reading.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
