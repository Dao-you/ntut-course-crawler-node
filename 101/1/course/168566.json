Not only do tardies lower your participation grade, if frequent, they will count as half an absence. Plan to arrive on time and be prepared to work during the entire class period. Coming to class late, wandering in and out of class, and leaving class early all disrupt class discussion and activities. In addition, you may miss important class announcements, assignments, and quizzes. Please keep in mind that if you have six unexcused absences, you will fail the course. Also, attendance requires your presence in both body and mind. If you are not prepared to participate and engage in class discussion and activities, you may be counted absent.","materials":"American Headway Level 4 (2nd edition), John and Liz Soars, Oxford","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
