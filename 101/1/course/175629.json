In this class, we ask: What's a service and how are good ones conceived and created? What can we, as designers, contribute to services for public buildings and space? What responsibilities do users as \"citizens\" rather than \"customers\" demand of designers? Drawing from my own interest in, research for, and links to, Taipei City agencies and service providers, we'll explore the kinds of relationships that services broker, and practice some key design processes and methods to understand how context of use, stakeholders, storytelling and mapping techniques shape services. In class and through assignments, we'll review a range of real life case studies in Taiwan and elsewhere. The class will be part seminar and part workshop. It's not a production class; instead, assignments will focus on written and sketching exercises, and reading. There will be opportunities to present, and, where successful, contribute your work to relevant experts/service providers. You'll enrich your participation in class discussions; reflect on the work of peers  and have a chance to rehearse your design skills. The main aim is that the materials and exercises that engage you in this class become broadly applicable to other projects.","schedule":"Week 1 \nIntroduction: Class Overview and Goal\nWhat is Service Design\nWeek 2 \nWhat is Service Design and in Public Space\nInvention/Intervention/Service/Experiences\nWeek3\nPublic Space and Public Building\nImage of the City\nWeek 4\nCase Studies Field Trip: Taipei Public Space and Buildings\nWeek 5 \nCase Studies Analysis and Discussion\nWeek 6\nService in City: The invisible Intervention Space and Information Space.\nWeek 7 \nService Design and User Experiences\nWeek 8 \nDesign Project Proposal Presentation and Discussion.\nWeek 9\nThe Interactive City","scorePolicy":"Quality of work and understanding of the exercises (20%)\nAttendance (10%)\nParticipation (10%)\nPresentation of Case Studies (25%)\nFinal Project Design and Report (35%)","materials":"to be assigned","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false},{"name":"曾蘭婷","email":"tslotty@gmail.com","latestUpdate":"2012-10-11 16:00:59","objective":"What makes a good city is one of the leading issues to the profession building and planning. Being a designer, there have been challenges as making a good place to serve where people are. If the urban environment affords something valuable to our daily lives, designers play a role to deliver agreeable experiences from behavior settings in public domain to human needs socially and culturally. Therefore, the class expects students knowing and learning the competence to enhance the ways of living in city. In this lecture, we ask: What's a service and how are good ones conceived and created? What can we do to benefit those who are served in need public space? We'll explore phases of service design that services are discovered, defined, developed and delivered in of TAIPEI city. Based on real servicescapes in our public space, the design processes and methods reveal how context of use, stakeholders, storytelling and mapping techniques shape services.","schedule":"Week 1 (19Sept2012) \nINTRODUCTION, Class overview, goals \n���nReview this syllabus \n���nThe designers. \n���nWhat is service design and in public space and building and is it for? \n[REQUIRED reading]Bill Moggridge, Designing Interactions, ch6 \nJane Fulton Suri, Thoughtless Acts \nRoger Martin, Opposable Minds \n(www.doorsofperception.com/archives/alist_top_posts/ see july 18, 2006) \n\nWeek 2 (24Sept2012) \nSETTING a CONTEXT \n���nDo we mean public space or public sphere? \n���nPrimacy of place: Location-based \n���nContext of use/experience \n���nWhen is a service not a service? \n[REQUIRED reading]Stefan Moritz, SERVICE DESIGN – PRACTICAL ACCESS TO AN EVOLVING FIELD \n[REQUIRED reading]Setha Low/Neil Smith, The Politics of Public Space (CUNY) \n[REQUIRED reading]Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things \nEverywhere \n\nWeek 3 (01Oct2012) \nINVISIBLE INTERVENTIONS \nSPACE, PLACE and INFORMATION \nThe CITY -- Service experience at urban scale \n-- Designer as agent provocateur, enabler or others’ agency \n[REQUIRED reading]  William H.
