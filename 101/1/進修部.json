People do not need a formal background in science to enjoy and excel in this course, just a lively intellectual curiosity. A few background essays will help you understand many of the scientific concepts and attitudes we will encounter in the literature we read. While the course does have a central thematic interest in science and technology, our main focus will always be on analyzing literature and its interaction with science and technology. We will continually ask how form, or the construction of a literary work, relates to content, or the meaning of a literary work. This means our main focus will be to analyze the techniques that writers"},"id":"175490","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"職英文所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=101&sem=1&code=1664","code":"1664"}],"teacher":[{"name":"柯萊恩","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=101&sem=1&code=11197","code":"11197"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["A","B","C"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"共同301_1","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=101&sem=1&code=117","code":"117"}],"people":"7","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5425505","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=175490&code=11197"]},{"code":"5426608","name":{"zh":"通俗小說與英語文教學","en":"Teaching English through Popular Fiction"},"description":{"zh":"本課程是為在小學、國中、高中、與職業技術等學校之英語文教師教學需要而設計之英文課程。透過以暢銷書、犯罪小說、偵探小說、言情小說、科幻小說、驚悚小說、恐怖小說、與西部小說等通俗小說，作為大學以下各級英語文教學之主要或輔助教材，藉以提升學生口說、閱讀、寫作等表達能力。文學小說通常比較困難，通俗小說多以娛樂為主，因此比較易讀易懂。Elizabeth Lowell曾經說過：「好的通俗小說作者可以用普通語言創造不凡的意義，並且令耳熟能詳的故事蘊含新鮮而且令人興奮的內容。」的確，我們不應將通俗小說都鄙視成千篇一律、逃避現實的故事。一般人之所以受到通俗小說的吸引，主要是因為通俗小說故事內容與現實生活的各個層面幾乎息息相關。在本課程裡，我們將討論諸如Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, John Grisham's The Firm, Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park, and Louis L'Amour's McQueen of the Tumbling K等通俗小說。修習本課程的學生亦可推薦對未來英語文教學有助益之教材，作為上課教材。","en":"This course is designed for elementary school, junior high school, senior high school, and vocational and technical school English teachers who are interested in teaching and learning English through popular fiction that appears as the bestseller, crime fiction, detective fiction, popular romance, science fiction, thriller, horror, and Western, etc. While literary fiction tends to be difficult, popular fiction is usually entertaining and accessible. As Elizabeth Lowell has suggested, a good author of popular fiction can \"make the common language uncommonly meaningful\" and \"make an often-told tale freshly exciting.\" Indeed, popular fiction cannot be scorned simply as \"formulaic escapism\" that has nothing to do with reality. People are attracted to popular fiction especially because of its relevance to almost every aspect of human life.
