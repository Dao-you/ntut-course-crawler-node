In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen."},"id":"168207","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四車一","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=101&sem=1&code=1590","code":"1590"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["5","6"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--哲學(三)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419983","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1419984","name":{"zh":"博雅核心課程-法治","en":"Core Curriculum of Liberal Arts Education：Nomocracy"},"description":{"zh":"本課程以民主、法治課程為核心，重在強化公民的素養，增進政治體制及法律運作實務等之相關課程。","en":"Democracy and nomocracy are the core curriculum, focusing on enhancing the quality of citizens and promoting the related courses in  the political system, the operation of the law practices and so on."},"id":"168208","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四車一","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=101&sem=1&code=1590","code":"1590"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["5","6"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--法治(一)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419984","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1401032","name":{"zh":"微積分","en":"Calculus"},"description":{"zh":"本課程希望在一學年中，能使學生對微分及積分有充分的瞭解、培養邏輯推理、啟發思考創造、強化計算演繹並注重應用與作圖，以建立同學未來學習工程數學及相關專業課程之數學基礎，充分達到學以致用的目的。課程內容包括：1.極限與連續，2.導數及其應用，3.不定積分與定積分，4.超越函數及其反函數，5.積分法則，6.不定型與瑕積分，7.定積分的應用，8.空間幾何與向量微積分，9.偏導數，10.重積分。","en":"This course aims at developing comprehension of Derivation and Integral、activating capabilities of Logic Inference and Induction、enlightening confidence and independence、strengthening calculating abilities with an emphasis on its application and diagram、furnishing a sound basis for future specialty.

As long as there are people, there will be stories. As soon as a child sat on his mother's lap, the story is his way of understanding the world. Human civilization for thousands of years circulated tirelessly through the accumulated stories. From both the East and the West, the Plato and China's \"Book of Poetry\", even the Analects of Confucius, Zhuangzi, mythology, Buddhism, or the Greek philosophy of \"Dialogue\" all recorded with the form of stories. The influence of the story not only became the rule of history and an important tool of social and moral teachings, they also became the anti-mainstream values expressions. The story even forms meanings in personal investigations. Moreover, in today's information society, story is no longer the power of writers and artists, the story has become the skills of leadership and charisma, and the power of the plot has become the key to the construction of marking brands."},"id":"168683","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"▲","class":[{"name":"四文一","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=101&sem=1&code=1600","code":"1600"}],"teacher":[{"name":"劉秋蘭","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=101&sem=1&code=11222","code":"11222"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["3","4"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教311(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=101&sem=1&code=51","code":"51"}],"people":"49","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=A501003","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=168683&code=11222"]},{"code":"A501004","name":{"zh":"閱讀書寫與討論","en":"Reading, writing and Discussion"},"description":{"zh":"作為一個文化人，除了必須具備敏銳的觀察力外，還需要培養閱讀與思考的能力，如此才能在文獻及資料的基礎上，對所觀察到的文化現象做出得體的詮析與釐清。而在反思、整理過後，若能將心中的概念或想法，以清楚的文字流暢地表達出來，方能達到文化傳播的效果，亦即從input走向 output，讓無形的理念能化為具體有形的文字。而為了協助同學順利聯結閱讀與討論這兩端，小組或課堂的討論是必需的，因為透過彼此意見的交換，一來能看到自身思考的盲點，二來能開拓視野，讓整體的概念更加清晰與完整。","en":"As a person in cultural related field, besides possess sharp outsight, need to cultivate the abilities of reading and thinking, so that can make proper annotations and analyses about observed culture.

The target is to investigate how a cultural/literary text is created in relation to, and in response to, another text in different media/genres, and how this \"chain reaction\" or \"web of influences\" displays a rippling effect that travels across the boundaries among painting, music, architecture, literature, and film.  For example, Vermeer's painting entitled \"The Girl with a Pearl Earring\" inspires the creation of a novel by Tracy Chevalier, which in turn facilitates the creation of a movie also with the same title. The case is the same with the musical piece of \"Gloomy Sunday\" which inspires the creation of many verbal/visual/audio art forms under the same title and even makes a social impact on increasing suicide cases.
