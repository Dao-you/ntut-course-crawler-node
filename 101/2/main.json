In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. As people often observe, Shakespeare may trigger our imagination with his language and promote effective communication in every aspect of our life, including that of our careers.

Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen."},"id":"173231","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四資一","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=101&sem=2&code=1594","code":"1594"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["1","2"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--哲學(一)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419983","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1419984","name":{"zh":"博雅核心課程-法治","en":"Core Curriculum of Liberal Arts Education：Nomocracy"},"description":{"zh":"本課程以民主、法治課程為核心，重在強化公民的素養，增進政治體制及法律運作實務等之相關課程。","en":"Democracy and nomocracy are the core curriculum, focusing on enhancing the quality of citizens and promoting the related courses in  the political system, the operation of the law practices and so on."},"id":"173232","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四資一","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=101&sem=2&code=1594","code":"1594"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["5","6"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--法治(一)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419984","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1401032","name":{"zh":"微積分","en":"Calculus"},"description":{"zh":"本課程希望在一學年中，能使學生對微分及積分有充分的瞭解、培養邏輯推理、啟發思考創造、強化計算演繹並注重應用與作圖，以建立同學未來學習工程數學及相關專業課程之數學基礎，充分達到學以致用的目的。課程內容包括：1.極限與連續，2.導數及其應用，3.不定積分與定積分，4.超越函數及其反函數，5.積分法則，6.不定型與瑕積分，7.定積分的應用，8.空間幾何與向量微積分，9.偏導數，10.重積分。","en":"This course aims at developing comprehension of Derivation and Integral、activating capabilities of Logic Inference and Induction、enlightening confidence and independence、strengthening calculating abilities with an emphasis on its application and diagram、furnishing a sound basis for future specialty.

Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen."},"id":"173327","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四電資二","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=101&sem=2&code=1503","code":"1503"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["3","4"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--哲學(二)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419983","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"3102084","name":{"zh":"電子學(二)","en":"Electronics (II)"},"description":{"zh":"線性電路；電算放大器；二極體；非線性電路應用；接面場效電晶體（JFET）；金屬氧化物半導體場效電晶體(MOSFET)；雙極性接面電晶體（BJT）；差動放大器；多級放大器。金氧半電晶體；雙接面電晶體；差動及多極放大器；功率放大器；頻率響應；回授；類比積體電路；濾波器；調諧放大器","en":"frequency response,feedback and stability,differential andmultistage amplifier,operational amplifier,analog integrated circuits."},"id":"173330","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"四電資二","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=101&sem=2&code=1503","code":"1503"}],"teacher":[{"name":"劉邦榮","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=101&sem=2&code=11611","code":"11611"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["5"],"thu":["3","4"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"六教326(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=101&sem=2&code=428","code":"428"}],"people":"32","peopleWithdraw":"2","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3102084","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=173330&code=11611"]},{"code":"3102092","name":{"zh":"電子學實習(二)","en":"Electronics Lab.

The most unique feature of this course will be its timeliness to fill a void in an important and emerging networking topic.

For those who are devoted to create new technological applications for learning, it is no doubt critical to construct new mechanism of learning in current highly digitized era.
