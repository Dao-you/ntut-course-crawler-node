No photocopied edition will be accepted for use in class. It is important for students to be aware that legal action will potentially be sought by the publisher in the case of using an unauthorized duplicated text.  \n(2)　　Students will form pairs on the first day of class and be responsible for in-class presentations as assigned. \n(3)　　Each student pair is required to conduct a PPT report on the assigned textbook section (see details). \ni.　　Student presentations cover a range of related topics in Chapter 5, 6, 7, and 9.\nii.　　All PPT presentations need to comply with the format as instructed and modeled by the instructor.\niii.　　Detailed notes of handouts for distribution in class need to incorporate all theories, arguments, discussions and studies reviewed in the textbook. English-Chinese bilingual handouts are preferred. \niv.　　A full-length, revised Chinese translation of the text is due for submission in two weeks after the presentation session. Assignments must be submitted both in electronic and paper forms. \n(4)　　Each student will be given abundant opportunities to provide his/ her response toward the assigned reading content as the lectures proceed. Students must complete all readings assigned prior to the class session.  \n(5)　　Students are required to take and organize class notes. \n(6)　　The instructor will not assign additional readings. However, as SLA is multi-disciplinary in nature, it comprises a broad array of theories and studies. Students who are highly interested in this field are strongly encouraged to consult the professor for further suggested readings.\n(7)　　Attendance: Students are required to attend the class as scheduled. \ni.　　Each unexcused absence will result in 10% semester grade deduction. \nii.　　At the sole discretion of the instructor, some absence penalties may be waived with valid proof and just cause. No Penalty waiver request will only be accepted in two weeks of the date of absence. Students forfeit the right of contention after that. It is important to know that only ONE- time penalty waiver will be granted to any student.  \niii.　　Lateness to class: Any arrival to class after the instructor finishes the second-round roll call is considered lateness. Two times of lateness will, in effect, incur a grade penalty of 5% semester grade deduction.\nEvaluation Procedures &amp; Grading System:\n　　Final grades will be determined by a point system (X out of 100 total points). Students will be evaluated by their presentations, handouts, full-length text translations, in-class exams, and attendance.\n(1)　　PPT Presentation &amp; Translation / Handouts 10%\n(2)　　Class Notes 10% \n(3)　　Exams (Midterm &amp; Final) 50% \n(4)　　Attendance 20%\n** Keep the syllabus for future reference.**","materials":"Required Text: Ellis, Rod.
