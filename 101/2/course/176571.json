The numerical results from finite elemtn analysis will not more accurate than the constitutive model in the finite element computer code. The stress and strain relationship is highly dependant on stress path, stress level, pore water pressure, soil density and loading rate. Therefore the implementation of soil constitutive model in finite element code is a challenging job. Finite element method is one of many important numerical modeling methos to provide the tool to analyze the soil-structure interaction problems. A finite element code, PLAXIS-3D, will be used to pratice the application of constitutive model in the lecture and homework assignments.","schedule":"1.  definition and application of constitutive model\n2.  relation between constitutive model and finite element method\n3.  definition and application of tensor（1）\n4.  definition and application of tensor（2）\n5.  strain definition and strain invariants\n6.  stress defomotopm amd stress omvaroamts\n7.  first and second order elastical models（1）\n8.  first and second order elastical models（2）\n9.  midterm exam\n10. hyoperbolic model（1）\n11. hyoperbolic model（2）\n12. plasticity（1）\n13. plasticity（2）\n14. plasticity（3）\n15. computer practice of constitutive law\n16. elasto-plastical model（1）\n17. elasto-plastical model（2）\n18. final exam","scorePolicy":"midterm and final exams are weighted 40% and 60%, respectively.","materials":"Constitutive Laws for Engineering Materials, by Desai and Siriwardane , 虹橋書店(name of book store)","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
