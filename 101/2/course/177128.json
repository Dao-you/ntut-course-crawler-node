Students will know the names, structural formulas and the uses of common polymers. \n2. Students will be familiar with the two major mechanisms of polymerization and understand how the differences between these infulence molecular weight and molecular weight distribution in a batch reactor.\n3. Students will learn about the common methods of measuring polymer molecular weight. \n4. Students will become familiar with the mechanical and barrier properties of solid polymers, both above and below the polymer glass glass transition temperature. \n5. Students will understand the solubility behavior of polymers.\n6. Students will understand the flow behavior of polymeric liquids.\n7. Students will learn to model some of the commom polymer processing operations.","schedule":"Topic                               　　Approximate no of classes\nIntroduction and classification of polymers　　       1\nMolecular weight and its distribution　　       1\nThe glass transition temperature     　　       1\nStep growth polymerization　　                         2\nChain growth polymerization　　                         2\nCrosslinking reactions　　                         1\nMeasurement of molecular weight　　                1\n　　Midterm Exam I\nThermodynamics of polymers                          1\nRubber elasticity　　                                  1\nPolymer crystallization　　                         2\nDynamic properties and temperature superposition    2\nDiffusion through solid polymers　　                1\nRheology　　                                           2\nPolymer processing　　                                  4\n         Final Exam","scorePolicy":"One midterm, one final@ 40%\nHomework 20%","materials":"Textbook: A.
