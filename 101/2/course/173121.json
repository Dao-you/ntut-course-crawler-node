Since the class size is so large we will continue to work in groups, but this can be advantageous since the students can help each other.  In each case the ‘audience’ to be convinced will be the students themselves who will ‘grade’ each essay and argument.  New techniques will be introduced for each group project.","scorePolicy":"Group Essays: 100%","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
