It also highlights the close relationship between course design and teaching as the teacher builds on knowledge. Students will present and discuss the viewpoints of various classroom teachers and researchers in both the ESL and the EFL contexts. They, therefore, are expected to finish the assigned readings before class and actively participate in class presentations and discussions.","schedule":"Week 1     Introduction\nWeek 2     Chapter 1\nWeek 3     Chapter 2\nWeek 4     Chapter 3\nWeek 5     Chapter 4 (Part I)\nWeek 6     Chapter 4 (Part II)\nWeek 7     No Class!\nWeek 8     Chapter 5 (Parts I &amp; II)\nWeek 9     Midterm Project Due\nWeek 10    Chapter 6 (Part I)\nWeek 11    Chapter 6 (Part II)\nWeek 12    Chapter 7\nWeek 13    Chapter 8 (Part I)\nWeek 14    Chapter 8 (Part II)\nWeek 15    Chapter 10\nWeek 16    Chapter 9\nWeek 17    No Class!\nWeek 18    Final Project Due","scorePolicy":"Class Participation: 40%\nMidterm Project: 30%\nFinal Project: 30%","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
