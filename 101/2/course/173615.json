The related process variation impacting the device performance will be delicately probed. Additionally, the device and product reliability in test items and analysis skill is mainly focused, too.","schedule":"Week　　　　Outline content\n01　　　　Introduction　　\n02　　　　Semiconductor materials\n03　　　　Quantum effect　　\n04　　　　Passive devices　　\n05　　　　Characteristics of passive devices　　\n06　　　　Active devices　　\n07　　　　Characteristics of active devices　　\n08　　　　Parameters of active devices　　\n09　　　　Mid-term exam.\n10　　　　Pattern designs　　\n11　　         Pattern designs　　\n12　　　　Parameter extraction　　\n13　　　　Parameter extraction (including charge pumping)\n14　　　　Oxide reliability analysis\n15　　　　Hot carrier effect　　\n16　　　　Metal migration analysis\n17　　　　Product reliability analysis (including ESD)\n18　　　　Final exam","scorePolicy":"Grading:\n1.　　Midterm Exam.: 20%\n2.　　Final Exam: 30%\n3.　　Quiz: 50%","materials":"Textbook: Self-lecture and published papers.\n\nReferences: \n1.
