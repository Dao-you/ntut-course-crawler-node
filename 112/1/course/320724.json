    "objective": "課程規劃的目標為以互動設計的理論為基礎，實務導向為原則，使學習者能將學術界的理論與產業界的實務加以結合以充實對於互動設計具有的了解。學習的內容包含互動設計系統構成要素、實務與理論基礎、方法與技術、科技支援與應用等單元，各單元並包含不同互動設計個案的研討，使理論能與實務進行驗證。課程亦安排至相關領域業界的參訪以及互動相關展覽參觀，以加深對於互動設計實務的印象與了解。\nThe course aims to develop broad understanding on interaction design for students, based on theory and practice course structure. Course topics include essential factors of interactive system, interaction design theory and practice, methods and techniques, technical support and application. Course also incorporates case studies, company visits and exhibitions relevant to interaction design to enhance the understanding of integrating theory and practice.",
