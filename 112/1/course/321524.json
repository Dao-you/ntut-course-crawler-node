    "objective": "This course is a graduate-level course for advanced big data analytics and applications. The major topics include: the concepts and principles of big data analytics, frameworks of distributed computing, and applications including: Link Analysis, Social Network Graph Mining, and Recommender Systems. The commonly used machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks and SVM will also be covered. \nIn addition to conceptual introduction, with intensive programming exercises in parallel programming and term project, students are expected to learn the machine learning tools, and the program design of real big data applications.",
