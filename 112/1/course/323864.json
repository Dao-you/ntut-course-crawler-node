    "objective": "本課程之教學目標在使學生瞭解訊號與系統之基本概念及分析方法，以作為通訊、控制、電子電路、濾波器設計及數位信號處理等課程修習之基礎。課程內容包含：(1) 標準訊號及訊號表示法 (2) 連續系統的數學分析 (3) 離散系統的數學分析 (4) 拉氏轉換分析 (5) Z - 轉換分析 (6) 傅立葉分析 (7) 工程應用。\nThis course contains the properties of signals, systems, LTI systems, and basis linear transforms. This is a basic course in the field of communication and control.\nThe course introduces the properties of signals and systems, and is a fundamental course for those who are interested in communications, signal processing, control systems, and electronic circuits. The student will learn about the basic concepts of continuous-time and discrete-time signal processing. The covered topics are:\n\n1. Signals and systems\n2. Linear time-invariant systems\n3. Fourier series representation of periodic signals\n4. The continuous-time Fourier transform\n5. The discrete-time Fourier transform\n6. Sampling\n7. Time and frequency characterization of signals and systems \n8. The Z-transform (optional)\n9. The Laplace-transform (optional)",
