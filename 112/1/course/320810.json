    "objective": "This course takes lithium-ion batteries as an example. It introduces current research challenges of lithium-ion batteries’ applications (i.e., electrical vehicles (EVs) and power grids). It then investigates battery system identification approaches, battery state-of-charge (SOC) estimation algorithms, battery state-of-health (SOH) prognosis algorithms, and related control theories. This course is set targeting institute students, where the goal of this course is to help them gain necessary domain knowledge, develop simulation and implementation skills, and improve their capabilities of reading and reporting journal papers.",
