    "objective": "本課程為研究所熱流科學基礎課程之一，內容主要包括質量、動量與能量守恆方程式的推導，以及它們的解析與近似解，應用範圍包含非旋轉流、低雷諾數流以及高雷諾數 (邊界層) 流等等。\nThis course is one of the fundamental courses in the thermofluid sciences for graduate students. Based upon the concept of conservation, the equations of mass, momentum, and energy will be derived. This course will deal with solutions of these equations, both exact and approximate. The application of solutions includes irrotational flow, low Reynolds number flow, and high Reynolds number (boundary layer) flow, etc.",
