In this course, world literatures in English, together with various cultural media (including newspaper, magazine and journal articles as well as Internet materials and films), will be examined to introduce students to Anglophone literatures and cultures. Students are expected to acquire via this course a nuanced, discriminating literary and cultural competency. With this cross-cultural literacy, they could help promote international understanding and global cultural exchange.",
