    "objective": "This course will be given in English and it surveys the principal concepts of fluid dynamics. Topics include mass and momentum conservation, the Navier-Stokes equation for viscous flows, as well as dimensional analysis. Emphasis is placed on being able to utilize the concepts to solve the real problems encountered during conducting research",
