    "objective": "Electrochemistry includes many different phenomena (e.g., corrosion and electrophoresis, electroanalytical sensors and batteries devices, the electroplating of metals, and the large-scale production of aluminum and chlorine technologies……). In addition to an overview of the basic principles of electrochemistry, the main emphasis here is on applying electro-analytical methods to the study of energy and biomedical systems.",
