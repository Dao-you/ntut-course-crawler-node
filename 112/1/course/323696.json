A review of grammatical ideas at high level is reinforced by correcting sentence errors, and revising awkward usage of words or sentence structures. The main subjects include English sentence structures, verbal usages, conjunctions, and sequences. Related topics for class discussion cover direct and indirect speech, sentence transformation and modification of sentences; (b) The second half of the course focuses on English rhetoric--principles of effective written and spoken communication. Topics for class discussion include reference, coherence, reverse structures and some related rhetorical concepts. It is hoped that the students will know better the significance brought about by the variations of different expressions that occur in the similar linguistic contexts.",
