The course focuses on various types of production-related data. By monitoring shop floor real-time data, production engineers may quickly identify and resolve abnormalities. By learning and analyzing past failure records and maintenance logs, the system may predict and diagnose production errors and provide predictive schedules for equipment maintenance. It helps companies to find a better balance between equipment failure occurrence and production scheduled downtime. The course includes applications in automatic pattern identification, recognition, and classification to assist decision-makers in improving product quality and production efficiency.",
