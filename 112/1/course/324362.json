    "objective": "在科技發展快速的年代，有些人認為產業和市場需要更多新的法律規範，也有些人認為舊有法律需要鬆綁。但無庸置疑地，法律在科技、產業與市場的發展中，扮演著一個攸關重要的角色。基於此，本課程嘗試以設計案例討論，鼓勵不同背景的學生，經由案例分析得到綜合性的知識、從中了解科技發展如何影響法律變遷，並進而學習專業的法律策略。\nIn an age of rapid technology advancement, some people might insist more laws are necessary to regulate the industry and the market, on the contrary, others might think de-regulation is the best approach to encourage the free flow of the market. Nonetheless, it is beyond question that law and regulations play an vital role in the technology-driven economy today. Therefore this course is designed to help students from various backgrounds to engage in the group discussions on assigned cases. Students are expected to learn how the technology development shapes the legal environment and learn how to analyze the legal strategies.",
