    "objective": "本課程主要探討多輸入多輸出系統 (MIMO) 其系統行為之描述，內容包括 MIMO 系統之穩定性分析、觀察性分析及其控制器設計，並探討 MIMO 系統的物理觀念及其數學描述的各種方法，是線性系統之進階課程，適合碩士班以上之學生學習。\nThe main objective of this course is to explore the behaviors of multivariable systems. The contents includes: stability analysis, observability analysis, and controller designs for MIMO linear systems. Besides, we will introduce the physical concept of MMIO linear systems and various methods of describing MIMO linear systems via mathematical model. This is an advanced course to linear system theory, and is especially for graduate students.",
