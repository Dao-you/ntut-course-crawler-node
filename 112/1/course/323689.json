The causes to produce bad power quality will be surveyed and the affection factors will be found. The methodology to analyzing the power system with respect to power quality problems are learned, from which the power quality indices will be calculated and their critical parameters will be found. In addition, the students must to learn to assess the power quality level based on local and international standards , and to find the strategies for improving power quality of a power system. in which the design methods for the practical improved measures will be learned.\n主要教材:\n1.(1) 教科書名 Electric Power Quality\n作者 G.
