    "objective": "This course aims to give the guidance to the film essay writing. In films, the off-screen elements usually play much profound roles than the on-screen ones. In the sense, the relation between the visuality and the hidden elements will be examined from scenes to scenes. Also, we will survey some of the philosophical, theoretical, and the critical literatures to further analyze the invisible aspects in the images.\n    During this course we will focus on the subjects of “Time” and “Film sounds”. Since both subjects are invisible and they are the cinematic elements that are significant to this art form. At the end of this course, the auteur films will be discussed. Course requirements include a midterm essay, an oral presentation, and a term paper .",
