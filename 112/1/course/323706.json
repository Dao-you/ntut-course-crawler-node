    "objective": "As an all-encompassing term, the word culture has multiple meanings. Anything involving human activity can be included in the domain of culture. Most importantly, culture is deeply connected with our sense of identity; our culture defines who we are. And culturally-determined identification can a blessing that empowers our subjectivity, but it can also be a confinement that we strive to be free from. In this course, we will approach important topics in cultural studies from the perspectives of gender, race, and violence, the three issues that most intrinsically connected to identity, by reading theoretical texts and critical essays and viewing related films. Ideally, the course will familiarize students with key concepts in cultural studies and cultivate their critical thinking. Furthermore, the instructor hopes that the course can help students identify potential topics of their senior projects and establish valid approaches.",
