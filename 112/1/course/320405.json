If you miss more than 2 classes (not including 2) without appropriate reasons, you will fail to receive the full grade of attendance. With more than 5 times of being absent, your participation score will also be affected. 2. Only being present during the roll call counts. If you're late, you'll be seen as absent. 3. Absence from a class is no excuse for not knowing the assignment and what has been discussed in class. It is the student’s responsibility to find out what has been covered in the class by checking 北科 i 學園 or getting handouts/notes from the classmates. No late work /make-up exams will be accepted (unless you have requested an extension and been given approval ahead of the deadline).]\n-20% Project\n-20 % In-class participation, assignments, quizzes, etc.\n-20% Final Exam\n-20% English Proficiency Midterm Exam",
