    "objective": "This is an introductory physics covering principles of mechanics, i.e., statics and dynamics; work and energy, conservation laws, waves, sound, temperature, heat transfer and thermodynamics. The course objectives include: 1.) A calculus based survey course of basic physics principles. 2.) Resolve a system of forces as they relate to the dynamics of motion. 3.) Explain Newton’s Laws of Motion and apply them in the analyses of problems. 4.) Apply the principles of motion and conduct controlled experiments. 5.) Solve problems and demonstrate the application of the scientific method.",
