    "objective": "This course is intended to provide you with an introduction to recent biomedical research activities in the area of tissue engineering. The term \"tissue engineering\" has been coined to describe the interdisciplinary field concerned with the study of generation or regeneration of tissues. Researchers in this area utilize knowledge of the molecular basis of cellular function and interactions, in combination with fundamental engineering principles, to gain insights into tissue structure and function, with the purpose of developing bioartificial tissues or enhancing native tissue function.",
