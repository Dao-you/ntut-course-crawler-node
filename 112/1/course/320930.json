    "objective": "This course introduces students to the process of data science, covering problem formulation, data acquisition, modeling and analysis, and presentation and integration into action. Students will learn useful skills as well as basic statistical methods by completing several hands-on problems focused on real-world data. This course starts with a brief introduction to multivariate data analysis and data summarization including visualization. Then it extends to focus on using data to develop predictive capabilities using supervised and unsupervised machine learning models (regression, classification, clustering, PCA, etc.).",
