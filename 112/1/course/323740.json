In the first half of the course, students are introduced to translation of multimedia texts on Facebook, TED and Wikipedia as well as the practice of fansubbing and video game translation. In the second half of the course, students gain increased awareness of audiovisual translation and continue with their theoretical and practical exploration in the subtitling of streaming and digital media texts both linguistically and culturally. Students’ performance and management of project-based tasks assist them in keeping abreast with the new trends and formulating appropriate translation strategies.
