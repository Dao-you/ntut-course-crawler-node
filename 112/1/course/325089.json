    "objective": "This is an applied science course that examines how the application of big data can enhance technical and functional capabilities and how the big data processing efficiency can be facilitated and monitored to achieve well-defined objectives.\nAs it is well known that an optimized result made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) could not be significantly achieved without big data. Nowadays, there are a wide variety of data type (mostly non-structured ones) in different applications, and we are generating much more data and faster than ever before. Thus, big data applications are impacting our daily life. However, there are problems using existing techniques to accommodate most of our interests. For example, accessing the data from disk in distributed systems and getting data to the processors are among the typical bottlenecks. \nThis course is designed to not only introduce Big Data application and trend with Hadoop, but also its processing technology and ecosystems which are capable of eliminating the bottlenecks by its unique methods for storing and processing data per common application scenario. In addition, the course provides the platforms for students’ paper reading, group/squad discussion, co-work assignment, case studies and presentation.\nThe course will introduce Apache Hadoop core technologies and administration with its major components including: Big Data (BD) in demand and its application trend, Core technologies of Hadoop for BD management, Hadoop Administration and management tool, Hadoop cluster deployment, YARN applications plus MapReduce, Hadoop cluster hardware and software, Introduction of Hadoop ecosystem projects, HDFS configuration for high availability (HA), Hadoop security, Cluster resource scheduling , hardware configuration, industrial case studies, forum/project discussion, etc..
