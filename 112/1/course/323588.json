    "objective": "此課程主要是含蓋無線通訊基頻訊號處理的理論基礎與系統架構，探討無線通道所能提供的通道容量以及可靠通訊。而大部分的課程內容會以目前熱門的多輸入多輸出 (MIMO) 傳輸為背景而進行探討。課程綱要如下:\n1. 無線通道模型\n2. 多樣性\n3. 通道容量\n4.MIMO I: 空間多工\n5.MIMO II: 通道容量與多工架構\n6.MIMO III: 多樣性與多工間取捨\n7.MIMO IV: 多使用者通訊\nThis course provides thefundamental theories and architectures for baseband wireless communications. It is concerned that how reliable communication can be achieved and what is the capacity a channel can provide. Much attention will be focused on the newly developed technology, referred to as multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) transmission.\nCourse outline:\n1.The Wireless Channel \n2.Diversity\n3.Capacity of Wireless Channels\n4.MIMO I: Spatial Multiplexing \n5.MIMO II: Capacity and Multiplexing Architectures\n6.MIMO III: Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff\n7.MIMO IV: Multiuser Communication",
