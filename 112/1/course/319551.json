    "objective": "Course Title:\t\tPublic Speaking and Debates\nCredit Hours:\t\t2\nInstructor’s Name:\tDr. Yun-Hua Yang\nContact E-Mail:\tyhyang@ntut.edu.tw\nOffice: \t        General Education Building Rm.805 / Extension: 3941\nTerm Offered:\t\tFall, 2022\nCourse Description: \tThis course aims to establish the foundation for English-major students to deliver public speeches in English. Students learn to select topics, collect essential information, analyze the audience, organize materials, improve delivery skills, distinguish different types of speeches, and further to evaluate their own and others’ speeches. Each student is expected to deliver at least 3-4 individual speeches, and 2-3 debates. Speech topics will be discussed and assigned to students. Any modifications of the speech topics will have to be approved by the instructor. All student speech sessions must be videotaped.(see note 1) \nCourse Requirements: \tStudents’ responsibilities in this class include:\n(1)\tAttending class regularly and to arrive on time: \n(2)\tDelivering speeches as scheduled: \ni.\tStudents who are scheduled to give an in-class speech (for official grading) need to record a pre-speech on the scheduled day. (see note 2)\nii.\tMake-up speech will be only allowed when the failure to perform is due to an officially excused absence or incidents under extreme circumstances\niii.\tThe ideal time duration for each speech is 4 to 6 minutes. The minimum length of speech time is 3 minutes, and the maximum 6. Violation of the time limit (less than 3 and more than 6) constitutes a failure w/o points awarded. The time length for debates will vary due to the different formats employed.\niv.\tIt is essential to comply with the prescriptive requirements for each speech. Failure to follow will result in disqualification to complete the speech \n(3)\tSubmitting to the instructor a speech file with inclusion of the outlined speech as well as the full-length speech script (with citation and references), the speech evaluation sheet, the self-evaluating commentaries of both the current and previous speeches, and also blank A-4 size lined sheets for notes and feedbacks(see Appendix 1 & 2) when presenting the speech. Students who do not have the file ready and fail to comply with the outline format requirements (sampled and specified below_Appendix 3) forfeit the right to deliver the speech and hence receive zero points.  \n(4)\tStudent speakers are also required to display their outline slide(s) during the speech. \n(5)\tEvaluating one’s own speech (by the self-evaluation guideline): Student speakers are required to watch their own videotaped speeches (both pre-speech and in-class speech) observe their own speeches, and compile all speech and debate evaluation for submission. Students are strongly advised to use their own videotaping devices for both the pre and in-class speeches. Post-class recordings will be arranged and produced in the Lab, if necessary. A complete portfolio (preferably on compact disc) including all recordings is required for submission at the semester end.",

Students who do not get to deliver an in-class speech (by arrangement or choice) can decide whether to use the pre-speech for official grading. It should be noted that speeches delivered in-class receives instructor’s comments and will be considered extra credits. For Class A, the pre-speech session starts at 8:10 to 8:40 in Rm 401. For Class B, the pre-speech starts at 10:10 to 10:40 in the Lab. More details of arrangement will be discussed. \n3) Students are obligated to attend all class sessions. Each absence will generate 10% point deduction of the semester grades on the 100% scale. \n4) All extemporaneous speeches allow speakers to deliver the speech with its outline and necessary visual aids, such as flash cards, posters and PPT slides. Student speakers who use a script at speech delivery will result in the total loss of the component grade. (For each speech, students shall keep the comments/grades (on speech card) for the purpose of monitoring their performance and the final result.) \n5) The implementation of the final debate match is likely to be subject to certain contingent occurrences as the class proceeds. Exact date, format and related matters will have to be discussed and determined later in the semester. \n6) Students are required to submit the speech assessment portfolio at the end of the semester. Failure to submit the portfolio will override the grades received in other grading components and thus results in a failing grade.\n(Course content and activities are to be adjusted for effective teaching and learning. The above syllabus is thus subject to modification as the class proceeds. Updated info will be provided when necessary.)",
