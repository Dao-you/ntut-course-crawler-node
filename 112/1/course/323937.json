    "objective": "This course is designed as the precursor course selected by seniors and graduate students. It covers the basic knowledge of the atmospheric boundary layer, bluff-body aerodynamics, aero-elasticity, the wind-resistant design of buildings, and the concept of wind-resistant design of bridges. National and international wind codes for buildings and bridges are introduced with practices based on wind tunnel test data. Other related wind issues are also conceptually introduced in this course.",
