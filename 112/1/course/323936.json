    "objective": "This course covers the theory and practice of scientific visualization, which is the graphical process of creating effective visual representations of 2D and 3D scientific data sets. The course will teach students the techniques and tools for generating, manipulating, analyzing and displaying various types of data, such as scalar fields, vector fields, and images. The course will also introduce some topics related to machine learning and graphical processing unit (GPU). \n\nBy the end of this course, students should be able to:\n\n1. Apply appropriate visualization techniques for different types of data \n2. Use existing visualization software packages and libraries, including Python Matplotlib and Matlab.\n3. Describe the current technical relationship between GPU, image processing, and machine learning.",
