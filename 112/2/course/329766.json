    "objective": "傳統發音教學大多根據教師直覺認為語音是該如何產製的、或發音課本中教條式的規則。在這堂課，學生將透過具體的聲學和構音資料、來學習重要語音學原則，並學習將原則正確地應用在發音教學當中。學生也將探討如何將這些知識轉化成不同年齡層和語言程度之學生可以接受的內容。\nTraditionally, teaching pronunciation has been based on \"armchair data\" (e.g., the instructor's intuition on how a sound should be articulated) or prescriptive statements in pronunciation textbooks. In this course, students will learn fundamental principles of phonetics through experimental acoustic and articulatory data and learn how to apply them to pronunciation teaching. Students will be challenged to translate what they have learned into digestible pronunciation instructions for students of different ages and proficiency levels.",
