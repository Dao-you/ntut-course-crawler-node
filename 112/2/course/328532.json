Design of railway vehicles should consider both the engineering and interdisciplinary cultural design at the same time.  A designer should consider not only engineering regulations and requirements, but also concepts of cultural design.  This course covers basic introduction of railway vehicle system, basic analysis of vehicle structures and dynamics, vehicle interior and exterior functional design, and railway culture.  The industrial tour in this course helps students to realize the theoretical and practical parts of railway vehicles.  This course is a joint lecture instructed by professional faculties from Railway Vehicle Research Center, Department of Vehicle Engineering, and Department of Cultural Vocation Development.",

    "objective": "The course focuses on the fundamental theory and concept of \"Engineering Optimization Methods\", \"Linear Programming\", \"Nonlinear Programming\", \"Multi-objective Function Optimization\", \"Modern Mathematical Planning Methods\", and \"Cross-Attribute System Optimization.\" Hands-on practices using optimization software, and term projects are some key elements. Students will report out their own term project at the end of the semester. \n\nIn this semester, University Social Responsibility (USR) concept is brought into the class. Encourage student to participate the USR project. Guide students to apply the optimization method in the thinking and planning process. Through the study, students can have better understanding about the optimization principle and apply it to the daily activities. It is expected that students can apply what have learned in the classes to their own daily activities, vehicle design, and research applications; and combine USR project into the term projects.
