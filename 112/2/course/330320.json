    "objective": "課程兩個主要目標為光譜學方法及分離方法。光譜學方法內容含紫外、可見、紅光、核磁、x-ray 等光譜法。電子譜及質譜也將被討論。分離方法方面有液層、氣層、膠層等層析法。分離後串聯之光譜分析也會學習。\nTwo major goals of this course are spectroscopy and separation methods. Spectroscopy methods include ultraviolet, visible, infrared, nuclear magnetic, and x-ray spectroscopies.Election and mass spectrometry are also included. Separation methods are: gas, liquid, and gel chromatographies. In addition, GC-MS,LC-MS, GC-IR, etc. will be studied.",
