    "objective": "配合化學課程之進展，教導學生學習各項基本實驗操作及儀器設備之技巧，進行各項實驗課程，如 COD 的測定，氮莫耳體積之測定，錯合物之生成，氧化還原滴定，蒸汽壓，測量溶解度，反應速率，化學平衡，耐綸 - 6,6 之製備以訓練學生養成手腦並用的務實科學素養。\nFollowing the progress of the course of chemistry, introduce chemical engineering students to learn basically operations and techniques for several kinds of devices. Scheduling laboratory experiments include the determination of COD, the determination of molar nitrogen volume, the synthesis of complex, the determination of redox titration, vapor pressure, the determination the solubility, rates of chemical reactions, chemical equilibrium, and the preparation of Nylon-6, 6. This course is designed to train students how to use their brain and hands simultaneously and to settle down their science concepts.",
