    "objective": "The course of Chinese is categorized as three individual stages for four years. In the first year, the course focuses on : (a) Basic Sentence Patterns, (b) Basic Conversation, (c) Languages in the Real Life and (d) the phonetic system for the Chinese language. In the second and the third year, the training focuses on paragraph reading and term/character recognition-in addition to the teaching themes set in the first year. Writing courses are also added during this stage. In the fourth year, we add more emphasis on the conversational ability, term/character recognition and reading ability. More culture-related information will be included.",
