    "objective": "本課程針對在不同物理和化學機制下顏色產生的原因，如振動和簡單的激發解釋了白熾（如：火焰）、氣體激發（如：霓虹管、極光）和震動與旋轉（如：藍冰和水）的顏色等，以及染料和顏料之化學結構、製造方式和基本化性予以闡述，以便對色料的相關應用有較為明晰的瞭解。\nThis course targets at the color derived from a variety of physical and chemical mechanisms are summarized. Includes vibrations and simple excitations to explain the colors of incandescence (e.g., flames), gas excitations (neon tube, aurora), and vibrations and rotations (blue ice and water). And also chemical structure, manufacturing and properties of main dyes and pigments are studied. Further applications of the color stuff are explained.",
