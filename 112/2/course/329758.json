    "objective": "在 20 世紀末和 21 世紀初，另類藝術形式 —— 電影、漫畫書、電子遊戲 —— 在塑造我們的文化和日常生活方面變得越來越有影響力。\n看看電影、電視和其他形式的流行文化，如流行音樂和漫畫書，我們將考慮西方和東方流行文化的本質和意義。 我們要問的問題包括：流行文化與學校通常學習的傳統或「高雅」文化有何不同？ 評價此類作品的標準是什麼？ 我們是否應該像重視經典作品一樣重視流行文化作品？ 流行文化的好與壞有差別嗎：流行的東西一定是好的嗎？ 流行的一定是好的嗎？\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, alternative forms of art – movies, comic books, video games – became increasingly influential in shaping our culture and our daily lives.\nLooking at films, television, and other forms of pop culture like pop music and comic books, we will consider the nature and significance of pop culture in the West and in the East.  Among the questions we will ask:  How does pop culture differ from traditional or “high” culture normally studied in schools?  What are the standards for evaluating such works?  Should we value pop culture works in the same way as classic works?  Is there a difference between good and bad pop culture:   Can what is popular be good? Must what is popular be good?",
