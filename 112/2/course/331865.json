    "objective": "係利用物理機械整理及化學處理方式，改善紡織品之吸引性、服務性和最終用途之機能性。整理加工技術包括結構穩定性 (諸如壓縮、煮呢、蒸呢、熱定型)；表面特性改質 (諸如平滑性、粗糙性、光澤性及其他美觀性質) 與功能性改質 (諸如防縐、防縮、防火、防污、防水、防微生物與昆蟲、耐光、耐冷熱、耐污染質及化學藥劑、耐氣候、耐摩擦、抗起球、抗靜電)。\nThe attractiveness, serriceability and end-use performance of textiles are imporved by the application of physical mechanical and chemical processes.  Finishing techniques include dismensional stabilization (such as, sanforization, crabbing, decatizing, heat-setting),modification of surface characteristics (such as, smoothness, roughness, luster, other esthetic fabric qualities) and functional property modification (such as, resistance to wrinkle shrinkage, fire, soils and stains, water, microorganisms and insect, light, heat and cold, air pollutants and chemical agents, weathering, abrasion, pilling and static change).",
