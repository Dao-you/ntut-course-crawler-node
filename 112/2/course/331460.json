    "objective": "This course immerses industrial design students in the world of generative AI. Each week, students will explore a different aspect or tool of generative AI, understanding how to integrate artificial intelligence into the design process to create innovative, data-driven solutions. Through hands-on experience, collaborative projects, and peer teaching, students will become adept at leveraging AI for design ideation, development, and execution. By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive portfolio showcasing their proficiency in using generative AI to push the boundaries of industrial design.\n\n這門課主要探索生成式人工智慧的不同面向和工具對工業設計的影響，透過實際操作和教學觀摩，學生將更深入了解如何將生成式人工智慧整合進設計過程中，創造數據驅動的創新解決方案。",
