    "objective": "Feedback control is an interdisciplinary field in that control is applied to systems in every conceivable area of engineering.  Consequently, control is an active field of research and hence there is a steady influx of new concepts, ideas, and techniques.  Some of these elements develop to the point where they join the list of things every control engineer must know.  This is the course where students, especially EE majors, begin to acquire both traditional and modern topics in the field of control systems.  The core material covered in this course is to provide ample motivation, insight, and understanding in classical control.\nThe goals of the course can be summarized as below:\n\tMaster design as well as analysis techniques.  Find good feedback control design with clear understanding.  Moreover, seeing them used.\n\tLearn to solve problems by constructing effective algorithms in computer languages like Matlab and Simulink.\nThe course is presented in a standard format of lectures, readings, and problem sets.  In addition to a midterm and a final examination, there will be a number of homework  quizzes equally spaced over the term, all in-class.  The quiz questions are based on assigned problem sets in the textbook.  All quizzes/examinations will be closed book.  Class participation is evaluated through attendance (7 points) and class interactions (3 points).  Full attendance students get 7 points.  One point deduction per missing lecture.  Each class interaction with correct answer gets 1 point.  Maximum 3 points for class interactions.  The lecture will be based mainly, but not entirely, on material in the textbook.  Students are especially encouraged to read related textbooks in the field of control systems in addition to lecture notes of the course.\n\nRemarks 備註：\n\tCourse lectures are offered in Chinese. 本課程為中文授課，惟教科書、講義、試題皆以英語呈現。\n\tTextbook should be purchased asap as it is a very good reference for study in robotics. 教科書應儘快購買。\n\tCourse lecture notes can only be downloaded via iStudy website and are protected under the Intellectual Property law.  Lecture notes are NOT freely distributed. 課程講義可於 iStudy 網站下載，請尊重智慧財產權，不可散布課程相關檔案及文件。\n\tAll announcements will be made via iStudy website. Class group via Line will be established in the first class. 所有課程相關訊息將公告於北科 i 學園 +、並於第一週上課時成立課程 Line 群組。",
