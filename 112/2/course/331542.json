    "objective": "Advanced Robotics and Automation Applications (ARAA) course is offered only for up to 28 graduate students with programming experience. In addition to lectures on robotic manipulation, ARAA requires oral presentations and reports on robotics papers also focuses on projects with mobile robots and manipulators in the topics of interest related to:\n\n1. Spatial descriptions and transformations  2. Manipulator kinematics  3. Manipulator inverse kinematics  4. Paper presentation and report  5. Project topics: manipulator and mobile robot control, and robot control system based on visual sensing\n\nCourse handouts will be available via iStudy web. In addition to homework assignments, a number of quizzes will be taken weekly during lectures. The quiz questions are based on problem sets in the textbook. Each student is required to make an oral presentation and submit a report based on a technical paper preferably related to proposed final project in related topics. All projects must be completed and evaluated in class under supervision of Professor and TA with particular attention to equipment operation safety.",
