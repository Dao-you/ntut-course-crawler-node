    "objective": "Hydrological measurements are made to obtain data on hydrological processes. They are essential for the interpretation of quality and quantity data for water resource planning and management. The main topics include: measurement of atmospheric water (temperature, pressure, moisture, precipitation, wind velocity, evaporation, evapotanspiration), measurement of surface water (water stage, flow velocity, discharge computation, sediment, rating curve), and measurement of subsurface water (soil moisture, infiltration, ground water). The water quality monitoring will also introduced in this course.",
