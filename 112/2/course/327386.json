    "objective": "Welcome! This course is an introduction to the rich literary tradition of Great Britain and the U.S. Of course, since we are covering over one thousand years of literature, there will be much that will not fit into this course. \n\nMy main goals in this class are as follows:\n・\tTo encourage you to discover texts that you find you enjoy (or, at least, from which you learn something really important) but that you would not have otherwise discovered. \n・\tTo increase your knowledge of British and American history and culture. With a broader understanding of British and American cultural backgrounds, you will better understand current events, cultural nuances, and the way people think. You will also become a more interesting person to talk to. \n・\tTo provide you with stories and texts that you can draw on during the ups and downs of your life, now and in the future. \n・\tTo allow you reflect on your own and on others’ stories. (Reading literature has been shown in studies to make readers more empathetic, which is a great end in itself, but is also an extremely useful attribute for both your personal life and your career.)\n・\tTo help you improve your critical thinking and analytical skills. (Persistent readers of literature will definitely make great gains in these areas.) \n・\tTo help you increase your vocabulary and to find nuanced and interesting words to express yourself.\n・\tTo encourage you to seek out more texts (not taught in this course) that you would enjoy and/or learn from. \n\nNote: It is not recommended that non-major students take this class (unless they are fluent or near-fluent in English and willing to put a lot of time into the reading). \n\n本課程引導學生熟悉變遷中之英美文學作品典律，並探討其形成之歷史文化背景及隨變遷所產生之時代意義。課程中將討論與作品相關之社會、政治、文化、心理、哲學、理論等議題，使學生能瞭解欣賞選讀作品，並銳化其思辯能力及分析技巧。學生須於課前詳讀作品，並於課堂上參與討論。",
