    "objective": "區塊鏈技術 (作為比特幣等數位貨幣的核心) 已重塑了金融交易與分散式交互方式之未來。同時它也被期待帶給我們一個更自組與可提供事實證明的數位化世界。抽象化區塊鏈構造是非常精巧的，它倚賴輕量化密碼學工具搭配分散式系統概念，完成了開放、安全且有效率的系統 (如比特幣)。本課程為區塊鏈技術與應用上之概念介紹，包含：比特幣與區塊鏈設計、相關基礎密碼學工具、分散式網路與共識、區塊鏈應用。\nBlockchain techniques (the core of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin) have reshaped the future of financial transactions and decentralized interactions. They are also expected to bring us a more self-organizing and dependent digital world. The abstraction of blockchain is very delicate. It relies on cryptography tools and decentralized system concepts to achieve an open, secure, and efficient system (such as Bitcoin). This course aims to introduce the concepts of blockchain techniques and applications, including Bitcoin and blockchain design, basic cryptography tools, decentralized networks and consensus, and blockchain applications.",
