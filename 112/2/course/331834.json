    "objective": "This is a project based course to learn how to use the computer software to aid the engineering design. Students will form groups and choose a topic to design a mechanical device. Each group will have several presentations in the semester, which includes mechanical device selection, motivation, motion requirements, CAD drawing for the design, trouble shooting, and the simulation results. At the end of the semester, it is required to turn in a formal report that concludes the progress and the results.",
