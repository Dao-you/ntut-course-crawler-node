    "objective": "This course aims to provide essential knowledge about the mechanical behavior and design of critical members of a building frame. Main focus will be placed on the beam, column, and beam-column joint for their flexure, shear, bond, and anchorage behaviors. Besides, state-of-the-art research about the deteriorated hysteresis behavior and damage evaluation of reinforced concrete columns will be presented.",
    "schedule": "Major Topics include:\n1.\tDesign concepts of reinforced concrete members\n2.\tReinforced concrete material properties and quality controls\n3.\tMechanical behavior of reinforced concrete\n4.\tConfined concrete models and axial compression tests\n5.\tFundamentals of beam flexure\n6.\tMoment curvature analysis and software demonstration\n7.\tConcentrated plasticity approach for deflection calculations\n8.\tShear transfer mechanism and shear design\n9.\tBond and anchorage design\n10.\tCross-sectional analysis of columns and biaxial bending\n11.\tBehavior and design of beam-column joints\n12.\tCyclic behavior and analytical methods for RC columns\n13.\tDeteriorated hysteresis behavior of RC columns\n14.\tDamage evaluation of RC columns",
