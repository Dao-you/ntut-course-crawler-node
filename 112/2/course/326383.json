    "objective": "This module draws on the concurrent course in Heat, Mass and Momentum Transfer, which gives the necessary foundations. The aim of this module is to deepen the students knowledge of the unit operations with a focus on distillation, absorption, adsorption and drying processes. This provides a foundation for the Chemical Engineering. The present lectures will extend the Momentum Transfer to Heat and Mass Transfer. We will explore efficient short cut methods and briefly introduce the principles behind.",
