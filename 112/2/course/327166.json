    "objective": "This course covers the three Laws of Thermodynamics. Thermodynamic functions are introduced to calculate chemical potential energy of matters. Concepts of materials solutions, phase transformation, and activity of condensed phases are covered. The formation of phase diagrams and calculations for equilibrium of chemical reactions are discussed and evaluated.\n\n\n將熱力學定律應用於計算凝結相之化學位能與其平衡，逸壓和活性因素，溶液熱力學，多元金屬溶液，相圖和相變化，運用電腦模擬相反應和相圖，及研擬冶金數學模式。",
