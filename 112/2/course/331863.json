    "objective": "The course is designed to teach upper level graduate students about the recent advances in protein science and glycobiology with specific application in medical and biotechnological industries. The prerequisite classes for this course are: general organic chemistry, biochemistry, protein structure and glycobiology. Students are expected to learn the structure, biosynthesis, chemistry and cell biology in related to bioactive protein and glycconjugates.\nStudents must be highly motivated and required actively participated in class discussion.",
