    "objective": "This course presents analytic concepts in soft computing techniques. It is designed for the beginning graduate students who are interesting in application of soft computing techniques to engineer problems. Students should have a mathematical maturity typical of undergraduate curricula in science and engineering, including calculus and discrete mathematics.\n\nThe teaching approach in this course emphasizes modeling, analysis and design principles of soft computing techniques. The subject material includes genetic algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization. Case studies include several engineering applications.",
