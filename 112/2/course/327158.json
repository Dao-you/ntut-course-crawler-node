    "objective": "In the second semester, this course first introduces the physical behavior in a simple mixture system and describes the chemical equilibrium by physical variables and state function. Later, we will enter the microscopic world to see the fundamental particles with wave-like behavior. the quantum theory and methods are further introduced to the atomic/molecular orbitals and their energy levels. Finally, the molecular spectroscopy will be introduced.",
