    "objective": "Compared to the course last year, the course this year includes more materials about recent development of artificial intelligence (AI). The rapid development and population of digital imaging hardware and algorithms bring high potential of computer vision and image measurement on practical applications. These applications can include but not limited to measurement, structural health monitoring, and safety identification. \n\nThis course introduces the theory of computer vision and image measurement, guides students to operate and implement structural experiments and measurement projects. Students are encouraged to bring up the concepts and theories, programming skills, experimental design and implementation, oral presentations, as well as experimental documentation and technical writing ability.",
