You have to care about all walks of life, and actively observe and record their figures. Try to master both the charm and the form of the model.  Next focusing on static mono-figure sketching, you have to demonstrate your techniques in presenting either the static or the dynamic, the state of tension or looseness. You also have to be precise in proportion when you do your sketch. Stress definitely on the practice of speediness, simplicity, accuracy, and preciseness. Also work on static twin-figure and multi-figure sketching. Besides incorporating guidelines from the previous activity, you have to add the sense of spatial perspective to make your sketch more vivid and",
