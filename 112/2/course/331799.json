    "objective": "Course Overview:\nThis course aims to familiarize students with research methods in the design field, balancing academic outputs with practical applications. Through the latest literature produced under the concept of research-driven design, students will understand current research trends. The course will gradually guide students to become proficient in research methods.\n\nCourse Objectives:\nDesign science research emphasizes creating and solving practical, real-world problems. The goal is to develop solutions with practical value that can be implemented in practice or to further validate designs. \nStudents will learn to:\n* Understand the scope and trends of design science.\n* Comprehend how to formulate research propositions and design research methods.\n* Grasp quantitative and qualitative research methods.\n* Interpret and visualize research findings.\n* Formulate research propositions, frameworks, processes, and methods.",
