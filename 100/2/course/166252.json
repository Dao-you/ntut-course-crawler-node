These Approaches are: Classical, Humanist, Structural, Post-Structural, Feminist, Ideological, and Psychoanalytical.  Some of the figures at least a we will read at least a few pages of include Plato, S. Johnson, H. Bloom; Saussure, Barthes, Derrida; Freud, Lacan, Irigaray; Fanon, Said; Marx, Zizek.  Some (if not all) the readings will be bewilderingly difficult, therefore we will attempt to grasp only basic concepts which students will undoubtedly encounter and may wish to employ in the course of  researching and writing their MA theses.  I will focus on making the course useful.  That is, I will not be arguing that any one or another approach is better than another.\n\nReadings: 　　Handouts\n\nGrading: 　　MLA Style Mid-term Critique 40%  Final Critique 60%","schedule":"　","scorePolicy":"　","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
