In this course, we will focus on (i) statistical thermodynamics and (ii) chemical kinetics. The basic idea is how to study and to interpret chemical reaction from microscopic point of quantum chemistry to macroscopic point of thermodynamics. Here, statistical thermodynamics provides the link between the microscopic properties of matter and its bulk properties. Then, the rates of chemical reactions and reaction mechanisms will be discussed. Finally, the transition state theory inspires a thermodynamic approach to reaction rates will be applied to discuss the chemical reaction.\nOutline :\nThe course will include the following main topics :\n1.　　Statistical thermodynamics 1: the concepts\n2.　　Statistical thermodynamics 2: applications\n3.　　Molecules in motion- Kinetic Theory of Gases\n4.　　The rates of chemical reactions\n5.　　Reaction dynamics","schedule":"Week 1 :  Probability\nWeek 2:　　The Boltzmann Distribution\nWeek 3:　　Ensemble and Molecular Partition Functions (I)\nWeek 4: 　　Ensemble and Molecular Partition Functions (II)\nWeek 5:　　Statistical Thermodynamics (I)\nWeek 6:　　Statistical Thermodynamics (II)\nWeek 7:　　Kinetic Theory of Gases(I)\nWeek 8:　　Kinetic Theory of Gases(II)\nWeek 9:　　Midterm\nWeek 10:　　Elementary Chemical Kinetics (I)\nWeek 11:　　Elementary Chemical Kinetics (II)\nWeek 12:　　Transition State Theory (I)\nWeek 13:　　Transition State Theory (II)\nWeek 14:　　The dynamics of molecular collisions (I)\nWeek 15:　　The dynamics of molecular collisions (II)\nWeek 16:　　The dynamic of electron transfer (I)\nWeek 17:　　The dynamic of electron transfer (II)\nWeek 18:　　Final exam.","scorePolicy":"期中考 50%\n期末考 50%","materials":"Textbook :\n1.　　P.
