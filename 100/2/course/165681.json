They are essential for the interpretation of quality and quantity data for water resource planning and management. The main topics include: measurement of atmospheric water (temperature, pressure, moisture, precipitation, wind velocity, evaporation, evapotanspiration), measurement of surface water (water stage, flow velocity, discharge computation, sediment, rating curve), and measurement of subsurface water (soil moisture, infiltration, ground water). The water quality monitoring will also introduced in this course.","schedule":"週次　　授課內容\n1　　Introduction\n2　　Physical laws of fluid mechanics\n3　　Selection of gaging station sites\n4　　Measurement of stage\n5　　Measurement of bed levels\n6　　Discharge measurement-current meter method\n7　　Discharge measurement-moving-boat method\n8　　Computation of discharge \n9　　Mid-term exam.\n10　　Computation of discharge\n11　　Measurement of sediment transport\n12　　Weather monitoring\n13　　地下水觀測—水位觀測\n14　　地下水觀測—水質監測\n15　　地表入滲觀測\n16　　土壤水分變化觀測雨水收支平衡計量\n17　　地下水觀測站網規劃\n18　　期末考","scorePolicy":"Report and final exam.","materials":"(1) Franklin W.
