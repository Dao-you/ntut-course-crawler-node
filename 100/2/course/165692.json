Weights used to determine the final score will be:\n1. Homework problems, 15%\n2. In-Class Activities, Quizzes 10%\n3. Two exams, 60%\n4. Final Project 15%\nHomework Rules:\n1.　　Homework problems are due at the beginning of class.\n2.　　Please work the homework early to avoid lateness due to computer crashes.\n3.　　Answer keys will be posted on http://elearning.ntut.edu.tw\n4.　　You may discuss with others how to begin working problems, but you must work the problem entirely yourself to hand in for credit. You may not share computer files for homework problems until the case study.\n5.　　Anyone who share computer files or copy homework from classmates will subject to a 50% off his/her homework credit.\nExams:\nUnless otherwise specified, the three exams will be open-book exams. All exams will be held in our normal classroom.\nFinal Exam:\nThe final exam will be a comprehensive, open-book final. All students must take the final exam to pass the course. Finals will not be given at any other time. There will not be a make up exam.","materials":"References:\n1.　　R. K. Gupta, E. Kennel, and K. J.
