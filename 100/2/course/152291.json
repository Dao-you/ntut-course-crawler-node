This course covers object-oriented modeling for developing software. Materials covered include class models, state models, and interaction models in UML, a reference process model based on Unified process, implementation issues, and software engineering principles. This course is thinking and programming-intensive. Students are required to complete a non-trivial software project in two iterations. Only object-oriented languages such as C++/Java/C# are allowed.\n2. There will be no exams; instead, there are 7 homework assignments and two project reviews. All assignments turned in must be typed (no handwriting will be accepted).","scorePolicy":"Homework assignment schedule and grading policy:\nWeek 1　　Homework #1　　Project proposal 0%\nWeek 2　　Homework #2　　Iteration 1: Use case　　10%\nWeek 4　　Homework #3　　Iteration 1: Domain model　　10%\nWeek 5　　Homework #4　　Iteration 1: Design class diagram 10%\nWeek 7,8　　Midterm review　　Project presentation and review; 20 minutes per team.　　20%\nWeek 9　　Homework #5　　Iteration 1: Implementation class diagram 10%\nWeek 12　　Homework #6　　Iteration 2: Use case and domain model 10%\nWeek 13　　Homework #7　　Iteration 2: Design and implementation class diagram 10%\nWeek 16,17　　Final review　　Project presentation and review; 20 minutes per team.　　20%","materials":"Reference books:\nM.
