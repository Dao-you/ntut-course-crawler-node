During this time, the idea of how architecture and architects should be underwent a radical change, due largely to the massive industrialization, the rapid urbanization and the destructive wars. Most of the architects involved in the modern architecture movement were of the opinion that ‘modern architecture’ should play a role in improving the lives of modern people and in solving the problems caused by the modern society. A number of groups, schools, architects and their works which highlighted and contributed to the modern architecture movement will be introduced in this course","schedule":"Week 1:  An Introduction to the History of Modern Architecture\nWeek 2:  Architecture in the industrialization and the urbanization of the\n19th-century Europe\nWeek 3:  Structural Rationalism (Henri Labrouste, August Pugin, Eugène\nViollet-le-Duc, Auguste Perret and Hendrik Petrus Berlage)\nWeek 4:  New Architecture in the United States (Chicago School and Frank\nLloyd Wright)\nWeek 5:  Art Nouveau in France and Belgium (Hector Guimard, Victor Horta\nand Henry van de Velde)\nWeek 6:  Arts and Crafts Movement in the UK (John Ruskin William Morris,\nAugustus Pugin and Charles Rennie Mackintosh)\nWeek 7:  Day Off\nWeek 8:  Art Nouveau in Spain (Antoni Gaudí)\nWeek 9:  Midterm Exam\nWeek 10: Vienna Secession (Otto Wagner, Joseph Maria Olbrich and Adolf\nLoos)\nWeek 11: Jugendstil and Werkbund in Germany (Henry Van de Velde,\nRichard Riemerschmid, August Endell, Josef Hoffmann and Peter\nBehrens)\nWeek 12: De Sijl in the Netherlands (Theo van Doesburg, Piet Mondrian, J.
