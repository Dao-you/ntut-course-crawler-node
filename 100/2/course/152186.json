We will begin by focusing on the Asian influence on American modernist poetry and then turn to the response by Asian American writers to the American modernists. We will ask questions about translation, its purpose, its integrity, and its effects on the aims and practice of poetry. We will examine moments in poetry that move between language and about the power of language to move—to make us see, feel, and respond to that which is absent.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Ezra Pound and Ernest Fenollosa, “The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry”\nWeek 3: Pound, Lustra, Cathay\nWeek 4: Pound, Cathay\nWeek 5: Pound, Cathay, selections from The Cantos\nWeek 6: Imagism, poems by William Carlos Williams, Amy Lowell, and others\nWeek 7: poems by Gary Snyder, Kenneth Rexroth, and others\nWeek 8: Alex Hing, “Need for a United Asian-American Front,” Frank Chin, “Come All Ye Asian American Writers of the Real and the Fake”\nWeek 9: poems from Aiiieeeee! and The Big Aiiieeeee!\nWeek 10: poems from Aiiieeeee! and The Big Aiiieeeee!\nWeek 11: Garrett Hongo, Introduction to The Open Boat\nWeek 12: poems from The Open Boat\nWeek 13: Walter Lew, selections from Premonitions\nWeek 14: Cathy Song, School Figures\nWeek 15: Li-Young Lee, Rose\nWeek 16: Lee, Rose; Marilyn Chin, Rhapsody in Plain Yellow \nWeek 17: Chin, Rhapsody in Plain Yellow\nWeek 18: Wrap up, Final Essays due","scorePolicy":"Grading Policy: \nAttendance: 18 points\nParticipation: 36 points\nPresentation: 20 points\nFinal Essay: 30 points","materials":"see weekly syllabus.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
