Through product analysis, designers interpret characteristics of every single product of a specific market and gain a summary of the competition among brands. Lecture on methods of product analysis will be given followed by case studies and practice. Furthermore, the concept and theory of Product Service System (PSS) will be engaged to enhance a broader vision to customers’ requirement. A marketable set of products and services is capable of jointly fulfilling a user's needs and having a lower environmental impact than traditional business models. Workshop will be carried out to fulfilling this aspiration.","schedule":"1. Perspective on Product Analysis \n3. Defining Product Analysis\n4. Tools of Product Analysis\n6.
