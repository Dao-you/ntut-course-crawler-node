Applied linguistics addresses the need to understand how the role of language is played in many aspects of human activities in order to inform language-related policy making.\nCourse Objectives:  This course aims to help the students\n(1) to understand the principles governing applied linguistics studies\n(2) to examine studies and theories in major applied linguistics issues\n(3) to encourage students to engage in more applied linguistics studies\nCourse Requirements:\n(1)　　All students are required to use a copyrighted textbook. No photocopied edition will be accepted for use in class. It is important for students to be aware that legal action will potentially be sought by the publisher in the case of using an unauthorized duplicated text.\n(2)　　Submit a summary of the chapter section assigned to students and give a brief presentation.

Students must complete all readings assigned prior to the class session.\n(5)　　Additional readings will be assigned if necessary. As applied linguistics is multi-disciplinary in nature and comprises a broad array of theories and studies, students who are highly interested in this field are strongly encouraged to consult the professor for further suggested readings. In order to earn extra credits, students are obligated to submit a short critique of the recommended reading text.\n(6)　　Attendance: Students are required to attend the class as scheduled.\ni.　　Each unexcused absence will result in 10% semester grade deduction.\nii.　　At the sole discretion of the instructor, some absence penalties may be waived with valid proof and just cause.
