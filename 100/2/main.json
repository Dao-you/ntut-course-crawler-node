The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen."},"id":"151294","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四化一丙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=100&sem=2&code=1484","code":"1484"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["3","4"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--哲學(二)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419983","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1401032","name":{"zh":"微積分","en":"Calculus"},"description":{"zh":"本課程希望在一學年中，能使學生對微分及積分有充分的瞭解、培養邏輯推理、啟發思考創造、強化計算演繹並注重應用與作圖，以建立同學未來學習工程數學及相關專業課程之數學基礎，充分達到學以致用的目的。課程內容包括：1.極限與連續，2.導數及其應用，3.不定積分與定積分，4.超越函數及其反函數，5.積分法則，6.不定型與瑕積分，7.定積分的應用，8.空間幾何與向量微積分，9.偏導數，10.重積分。","en":"This course aims at developing comprehension of Derivation and Integral、activating capabilities of Logic Inference and Induction、enlightening confidence and independence、strengthening calculating abilities with an emphasis on its application and diagram、furnishing a sound basis for future specialty.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen."},"id":"152142","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四能二","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=100&sem=2&code=1394","code":"1394"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["5","6"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--哲學(三)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419983","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1419984","name":{"zh":"博雅核心課程-法治","en":"Core Curriculum of Liberal Arts Education：Nomocracy"},"description":{"zh":"本課程以民主、法治課程為核心，重在強化公民的素養，增進政治體制及法律運作實務等之相關課程。","en":"Democracy and nomocracy are the core curriculum, focusing on enhancing the quality of citizens and promoting the related courses in  the political system, the operation of the law practices and so on."},"id":"152143","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四能二","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=100&sem=2&code=1394","code":"1394"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["3","4"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--法治(二)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419984","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"4502503","name":{"zh":"空調工程與設計","en":"Air-conditioning engineering and design"},"description":{"zh":"本門課藉由濕空氣線圖討論空氣調節之過程，分析人體舒適與空氣品質之需求，及各種空調設備系統之設計。本門課在空調負荷計算原理與方法涵蓋輻射熱、熱傳導及熱儲存效應等之分析，系統設計包括送風與送水系統之計算與設計，及室內送風分佈之理論與設計。","en":"Air-conditioning processes are discussed by using psychrometric charts.

Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life.

It has developed rapidly over the past decade. The reason for the recent advances in structural geology has been the realization that naturally deformed rocks seen in field outcrops contain a fantastic range of small-scale features which relate directly to large-scale orogenic deformation systems. The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course.
