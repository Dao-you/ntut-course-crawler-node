The middle ages can be defined broadly as that period from the fall of the Roman Empire to the 15th century Italian Renaissance - a dark time, if one is to believe the men of the Renaissance, in need of light, knowledge, modernization.  Yet the stories of these dark ages - of Arthur and his knights, the Holy Grail, dragons and princesses - have endured beyond the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and even survived Post-Modernism.  In ways major (Hollywood blockbusters devoted to King Arthur, Beowulf, and the heroes of Tolkien's alternate medieval world) and minor (the frequent and creative use of the phrase \"holy grail\" in newspapers and popular maga"},"id":"152994","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"英文所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=100&sem=2&code=1517","code":"1517"}],"teacher":[{"name":"葛瑞斐","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=100&sem=2&code=11227","code":"11227"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["8","9","A"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"共同301_2","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=100&sem=2&code=478","code":"478"}],"people":"5","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5425502","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=152994&code=11227"]},{"code":"5605002","name":{"zh":"專題討論","en":"Engineering Seminar"},"description":{"zh":"專題報告、專題演講、研究小組討論","en":"Case Study, Seminar, Group Meeting."},"id":"153001","stage":"2","credit":"1.0","hours":"2","courseType":"▲","class":[{"name":"製科所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=100&sem=2&code=1518","code":"1518"}],"teacher":[{"name":"張合","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=100&sem=2&code=10381","code":"10381"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["3","4"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"綜一演講廳","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=100&sem=2&code=341","code":"341"}],"people":"58","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5605002","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=153001&code=10381"]},{"code":"4007006","name":{"zh":"奈米科技特論(二)","en":"Special Topics of Nanotechnology (II)"},"description":{"zh":"本課程分三單元，包括：(1)奈米薄膜製程與檢測技術：奈米薄膜之定義、種類，奈米薄膜特性與應用，奈米薄膜製程，物理蒸鍍法，化學蒸鍍法，超微結構之觀察、微區/微量之化學組成分析，微奈米材料之機械性質檢測，微奈米材料之磁性、光、電性檢測，微奈米材料檢測所需試片之加工技術。(2)奈米生物科技：細胞生物學，分子細胞生物學，病毒，DNA與蛋白質操控，光電生物技術，奈微米製程技術，生物高分子監測系統整合實例介紹，專題報告。(3)矽奈米電子元件：奈米矽技術簡介，奈米矽元件前瞻物理，各種奈米電子元件可能之應用，奈米矽元件之電特性量測，專題報告。","en":"(1) Nano Thin Film Processing and Characterizations: Definition classification, characteristics, and applications of nano-film, fabrication process, the related metrology and analysis tools of nano material.

The cinema has established a tradition of feeding on works of literature as a source of cultural and aesthetic nourishment. But the results for her are \"disastrous to both.\" As she puts it, \"Eye and brain are torn asunder ruthlessly as they try vainly to work in couples.\" Although Woolf might have been over pessimistic about the alliance between works of literature and film adaptations, yet her words ring true at times. In this course, we will explore the limitations and shortcomings as well as the potentialities and strengths of the film adaptations of literary works.

It has developed rapidly over the past decade. The reason for the recent advances in structural geology has been the realization that naturally deformed rocks seen in field outcrops contain a fantastic range of small-scale features which relate directly to large-scale orogenic deformation systems. The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course.

Within Service Design, Service Interfaces are designed for intangible products that are, from the customer's point of view, useful, profitable and desirable. This course explores the process and framework of service design. The process of service design applies explorative, generative, and evaluative design approaches. Designers observe and interpret requirements and behavioral patterns and then visualize, formulate, and choreograph solutions to problems. Tools that help to accomplish a successful service design are introduced. The analysis of existing services examines whether touch points are correctly positioned. Scenario Planning starts with the development of the client journey as a schema by which service design can capture and illustrate the complete process of a service with its emotional, material and procedural components from a client's perspective.
