Throughout the course, students will learn to develop their writing through dialogic interactions with texts, through class discussion and other collaborative class practices, and through sequenced assignments.  \nIn addition to the essays which aim to demonstrate essential writing skills, Jodi Picoult’s My Sister’s Keeper is especially selected for Project II. Students are required to compile a reading portfolio to demonstrate their progress as a close reader and reflective writer. It is hoped that through such an approach, students’ vocabulary power will be enriched, their ability in literary analysis cultivated, and their writing skill advanced.","schedule":"9/13　　Writer’s Block-----“Misconceptions about Writing”\n9/20　　Finding the Topic Sentence----“Gary Larson’s Cartoon”　　　　\n9/27　　Active Reading; Observing----“Jimson Weed”\n10/4　　Free Association----“My First Wrestling”　　　　\n         1st draft of Project I\n10/11　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n10/18　　Finding the Central Idea----“The Match”　　\n         2nd draft of Project I\n10/25　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher  \n11/1　　NTUT 100th Anniversary\n11/8　　How to Write a Summary ----“Daddy Tucked the Blanket”\n         Project I completed\n11/15   “Our Barbies, Ourselves”　　\n11/22　　How to Write a Paraphrase----“An Anthropologist on Mars” 12/6     Paraphrasing Poems by Robert Frost　　\n12/13　　Character Analysis　　----“Story of an Hour”　　\n         1st Draft of Project II\n12/20　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n12/27　　Analysis Paper----“Story of an Hour”　　\n         2nd Draft of Project II\n1/3　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n1/10　　Review and Discussion　　Project II completed","scorePolicy":"Criteria for Grading\n1.Project I :35% :(1st draft: 10%;  2nd draft: 10%; 3rd draft: 15%)\n2.Project II: 35%(1st draft: 10%;  2nd draft: 10%; 3rd draft: 15%)\n3.

My Sister’s Keeper, by Jodi Picoult (Jodi Pcioult’s Website: http://www.jodipicoult.com/)\n\nRequirements:\n1.　　Your regular attendance is required to pass this course.  3 unexcused absences \n    from class will result in failing this course.  One unexcused absence will result in an automatic final score reduction of 3 points.  If you are more than 20 minutes late to the class, it will be counted as an absence.  One late attendance means a 1 point reduction from your final score. \n2.  Throughout the semester, there will be in-class activities (peer-reviewing, group discussion) and in-class writings (free-writing, response to the selected reading text, peer comments, pair-writing).  If you fail to submit the exercise by the end of the class, there is no way to make it up (no exceptions).  However, your lowest score will be dropped—so, save this for the unexpected occasion when you might be sick or miss class for other reason.\n3.  All take-home assignments must be submitted on the day that they are due; otherwise, they are late.    A late paper will be penalized at the rate of 5 points reduction a day. \n4.  Each student should maintain a portfolio of your reading on My Sister’s Keeper. Your reading notes should be submitted every other week.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
