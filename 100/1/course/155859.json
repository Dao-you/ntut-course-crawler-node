Close attention will also be directed to the productive use of online English-learning resources and the development of an active learning attitude so as to help students keep improving their English ability beyond the classroom. \n\nThe course adopts an interactive approach to language learning by offering students ample opportunities to explore written texts, practice simulation tests, and challenge reading and listening tasks in class. GEPT Preparation Course will begin with a four-week preliminary session that includes an introduction to online resources for learning English in general. The formal lesson that follows will focus on weekly in-class practice and test review. \n\nPlease be noted that the course, instead of using a designated textbook, will rely exclusively on the NTUT GEPT Test Bank supplemented by simulation tests prepared by the instructor. Moreover, there will be neither mid-term nor final examination. However, students are required to tackle several in-class and take-home assignments plus a Course Project.","schedule":"September 13　　Course Introduction\nSeptember 19　　Learning English Anytime and Everywhere\nSeptember 26　　Use of English-English Dictionaries – Why and How\nOctober 3　　　　Introduction to Online English Learning Resources\nOctober 10　　National Day \nOctober 17　　Application of Online English-Learning Resources\nOctober 24　　In-Class Activity–Bingo Game for Independent Study\nOctober 31　　GEPT Preparation Test 1\nNovember 7　　GEPT Preparation Test 2\nNovember 14　　GEPT Preparation Test 3\nNovember 21　　GEPT Preparation Test 4\nNovember 28　　GEPT Preparation Test 5\nDecember 5　　GEPT Preparation Test 6\nDecember 12　　GEPT Preparation Test 7\nDecember 19　　GEPT Preparation Test 8\nDecember 26　　GEPT Preparation Test 9 \nJanuary 2　　　　EPT Preparation Test 10\nJanuary 9　　　　Course Review and Self-Evaluation","scorePolicy":"Attendance and Class Participation: 30%\nPreparation Tests and Assignments: 70%","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
