In the beginning of this course, digital-time signals, systems, and transforms are reviewed. Also, digital filter design including FIR and IIR filters are presented. Then, application implementation on speech, audio, and image processing is introduced.","schedule":"Weeks 　　Topics\n1　　Introduction, basic concepts of DSP\n2　　Discrete-time linear systems \n3　　Discrete-time linear systems \n4　　Z-transform\n5　　Z-transform\n6　　Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT)\n7　　Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT)\n8　　Frequency selective linear filtering and sample theorem\n9　　Sampling and Reconstruction Signals\n10　　Mid-Term Exam\n11　　Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\n12　　Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\n13　　Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\n14　　Implementation Discrete-Time Systems\n15　　FIR filter design\n16　　IIR filter design\n17　　Introduction of TI C28xx DSPs and their developmental tools\n18　　Final Exam","scorePolicy":"1 mid-term examination                      40% \n 1 final examination                         40%\n 1 final project                             20%","materials":"Textbook: J.
