Emphasis will also be given on geotechnical problems in earthquake engineering and their effects on artificial structures for the technically prepared student. The course will\n1. provide and familiarize student the basic understanding of the behavior of soils under seismic loads in earthquake-prone areas\n2. address different methodologies for measuring the dynamic properties of soils in the laboratory and in the field as well as parameters that affect these properties \n3. address soil dynamics and seismic effects on practical problems such as liquefaction of saturated soils, foundation design and slope stability","schedule":"1.
