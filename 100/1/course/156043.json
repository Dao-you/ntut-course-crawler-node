It includes the solution thermodynamics and chemical microstructure of polymer chains. The solution thermodynamics is to study lattice theory, statistical thermodynamics, Flory-Huggin theory, Flory-Krigbaum theory, phase separation, θ-temperature, Osmometry, GPC, and polymer gels. Light scattering and Neutron scattering are used to characterize the polymer microstructure. Polymer radius of gyration, freely rotating chains, excluded volume, fractal, and scaling are also discussed. Finally, spectroscopy methods are used to study polymerization models and microstructure.","schedule":"1. Introsduction Polymer Science (2 weeks)\n2. Chain Structure and Conformation (2 weeks)\n3.
