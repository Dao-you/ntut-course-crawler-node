The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

The task of decision making entails choosing between various alternatives. This choice is governed by our desire to make the \"best\" decision.

Optimization theory and methods deal with selecting the best alternative in the sense of the given objective function. The purpose of this course is to provide a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods. To accomplish this goal, we include many examples that illustrate the theory and algorithms discussed in the class.
