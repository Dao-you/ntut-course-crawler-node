The students are expected to learn different types of biomaterials, how to analyze the physical properties and mechanical test.  Biodegradable biomaterials such as hydrogels is introduced as a drug delivery system.  Finally, techniques for surface treatment of biomedical materials are elucidated.  Two advance medical applications on 3D in vitro system and cell and gene therapy are introduced in the class. \nStudents are expected to attend the classes and participated in the classes.","schedule":"Introduction to Biomaterials\n2 Biodegradable Polymers\n3 Natural Biomaterials\n4 Biodegradable Nanoparticles\n5.
