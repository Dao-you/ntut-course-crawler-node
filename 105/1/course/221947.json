The minimum length of speech time is 3 minutes, and the maximum 6. Violation of the time limit (less than 3 and more than 6) constitutes a failure w/o points awarded. The time length for debates will vary due to the different formats employed.\niv.　　It is essential to comply with the prescriptive requirements for each speech. Failure to follow will result in disqualification to complete the speech \n(3)　　Submitting to the instructor a speech file with inclusion of the outlined speech as well as the full-length speech script (with citation and references), the speech evaluation sheet, the self-evaluating commentaries of both the current and previous speeches, and also blank A-4 size lined sheets for notes and feedbacks(see Appendix 1 &amp; 2) when presenting the speech. Students who do not have the file ready and fail to comply with the outline format requirements (sampled and specified below_Appendix 3) forfeit the right to deliver the speech and hence receive zero points.  \n(4)　　Student speakers are also required to display their outline slide(s) during the speech. \n(5)　　Evaluating one’s own speech (by the self-evaluation guideline): Students are required to evaluate him/herself after delivering an in-class speech. Self-evaluation is to be submitted to TA (10 minutes before the class starts) for preliminary check to secure the right to give an in-class speech. All speeches have to be videotaped by the student speaker prior to the classroom speech. Student speakers are required to watch their own videotaped performance, observe their own speeches, and compile all speech and debate evaluation for submission. Students are strongly advised to use their own videotaping devices for both the pre and during class speeches. Post-class recordings will be arranged and produced in the Lab, if necessary. A complete portfolio (preferably on compact disc) including all recordings is required for submission at the semester end.","materials":"(1) No required texts / Extensive research required \n(2) For more information, please refer to the detailed syllabus and specific instructions discussed in class.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
