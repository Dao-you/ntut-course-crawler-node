intended as brief introduction to the subject of Ecological Engineering Methods(EEM), which is a whole new concept in the field of civil engineering. The Advantages of EEM is not only to satisfy the demand of safety(i.e. natural hazards control)but also that of protecting ecosystem and landscape aesthetic. In 2002, related government agencies try to pormote the application of EEM , and attempt to adopt this specific measure. However, the lack of basic understanding and knowledge has been the main reason why engineers are struggling in introducing EEM into reality. Therefore, including fundamental theories, cases study, and practical apects of application will be taught in this course.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.
