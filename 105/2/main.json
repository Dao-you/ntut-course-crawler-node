Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. As people often observe, Shakespeare may trigger our imagination with his language and promote effective communication in every aspect of our life, including that of our careers.

This is the most important factor of the interior design .It's factors including climate, politics, social ambience, economics conditions, materials ,and construction techniques. 2).To study the space planning of typical case of the each period. This unit is presented in terms of the floor plan as well as the three-dimensional characteristics, including the study of space layout,lighting,and the sequences of the space. 3).To study the interior architecture elements and their decoration. This unit is presented in terms of each interior elements such as floors, walls, windows, doors, ceilings, and stairways."},"id":"224878","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"▲","class":[{"name":"工設二","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=105&sem=2&code=1950","code":"1950"}],"teacher":[{"name":"龔柏洋","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=105&sem=2&code=23363","code":"23363"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["A","B"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"設計403","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=105&sem=2&code=375","code":"375"}],"people":"35","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"家室組","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3821124","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=224878&code=23363"]},{"code":"3822002","name":{"zh":"家具設計","en":"Furniture Design"},"description":{"zh":"本課程藉由家具相關設計競賽活動或產學合作計畫案，讓學生實際演練家具設計程序及創新方法。本課程同時配合家具材料、家具結構與實習、家具製圖、電腦輔助家具設計等課程，期能習得家具創新設計與產品工程的能力。","en":"The course through furniture design contest or industry-academy cooperation project, let students practice the design procedure and creative methods.

As organic molecules, biomolecules consist primarily of carbon and hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, and, to a smaller extent, phosphorus and sulfur."},"id":"226672","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"能源光電外國學生專班","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=105&sem=2&code=2117","code":"2117"}],"teacher":[{"name":"翁文慧","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=105&sem=2&code=11338","code":"11338"},{"name":"華國媛","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=105&sem=2&code=11165","code":"11165"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["2","3","4"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"四教302(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=105&sem=2&code=77","code":"77"}],"people":"8","peopleWithdraw":"1","ta":[],"language":"英語","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=A000022","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=226672&code=11338","ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=226672&code=11165"]},{"code":"3604051","name":{"zh":"科技行銷","en":"Technology Marketing"},"description":{"zh":"科技行銷的重點在於針對現在的科技產業、產品、技術、服務等等商品、巿場作一系統的、科學的、實務的研究與探討，其主要內容含：1.何謂科技產品，2.何謂科技巿場，3.科技產品的行銷定位，4.科技行銷策略研究，5.科技產品行銷推廣與調查，6.科技技術轉移及專利行銷，7.科技產業國際行銷，8.科技行銷的新趨勢。","en":"1.What is technology product? 2.What is technology marketing? 3.Strategy study of technology marketing. 4.Market survey of technology product. 5.Technology transfer.  6.Patent marketing.  7.International marketing strategy, 8.Development of technology marketing."},"id":"227838","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電子一甲","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=105&sem=2&code=2064","code":"2064"},{"name":"電子一乙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=105&sem=2&code=2065","code":"2065"}],"teacher":[{"name":"陳繩籌","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=105&sem=2&code=22048","code":"22048"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["B","C","D"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教203(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=105&sem=2&code=37","code":"37"}],"people":"35","peopleWithdraw":"1","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3604051","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1416005","name":{"zh":"生物學概論","en":"Introductory Biology"},"description":{"zh":"本課程是針對近代生物學感興趣的學生所設計，內容涵蓋生命與能量、細胞與分子生物學、生物多樣性、動植物的結構與功能、遺傳訊息的傳遞、生命的演化與生態。讓學生瞭解生命體系的輪廓，為生物科技的基礎課程。","en":"A one-term introductory course intended for students interesting in modern life science.
