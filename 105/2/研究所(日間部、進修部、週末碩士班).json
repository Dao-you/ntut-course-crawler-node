The course considers how the large-scale properties of solid materials result from their atomic-scale properties, through methods of quantum mechanics, crystallography, electromagnetism and metallurgy. The first part of this course is to introduce the foundations of quantum mechanics and statistics, including wave-particle duality, expectation value and measurement, eigenstates, boson and fermion. Secondly, we will explain some simple cases about mesoscopic physics of nano-structure materials, including free electron in 1D 2D and 3D, quantum slabs, quantum wires and quantum dots, tunneling and transition problems, transport theory and noise, quantum optics, many body effects and introductory group theory.
