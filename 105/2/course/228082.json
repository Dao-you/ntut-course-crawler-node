Integrating the knowledge and insights students have acquired in other courses, this course approaches literature comparatively. In the process of examining what a particular theme means across history, students should acquire further techniques which will be important throughout their postgraduate studies.\n\nOutlines: Literature and Revenge \n\nVirtually all works of literature (great or minor, classic or popular, literary or non-literary) are fascinated by revenge. It seems that the logic of human interactions has been dominated by the logic of vengeance. This course analyses how revenge is represented in cultural production including literature, film and various art works from Greek tragedies to contemporary films, including the European tradition and the modern Asian. \n\nThis course investigates to what extent revenge is ‘natural,’ instead of being culturally produced. Related issues including the concept of justice, the sense of guilt, law, time, gender, identity, anger, and violence will be examined by referring to different theoretical frameworks, including Nietzsche, Freud, Lacan, Foucault, Derrida.\n\nCourse Outline: \n\n1-3.
