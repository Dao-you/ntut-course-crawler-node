Based upon the concept of conservation, the equations of mass, momentum, and energy will be derived. This course will deal with solutions of these equations, both exact and approximate. The application of solutions includes irrotational flow, low Reynolds number flow, and high Reynolds number (boundary layer) flow, etc.","schedule":"Tentative Topics\n\n1.　　Basic Concepts of Fluid Mechanics\n2.　　Properties of Fluids\n3.　　Pressure and Fluid Statics\n4.　　Fluid Kinematics\n5.　　Mass, Bernoulli, and Energy Equations\n6.　　Momentum Analysis of Flow Systems\n7.　　Dimensional Analysis and Modeling\n8.　　Flow in Pipes\n9.　　Differential Analysis of Fluid Flow\n10.　　Approximate Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equation\n11.　　Flow over bodies: Lift and Drag","scorePolicy":"Homework 20%\nMid-term Exam 40%\nFinal Exam 40%","materials":"Textbook\nYunus A.
