An exploration will be made into their possible implications for translation practice and the translator's qualifications. Translation issues to be addressed may include the following: globalization/localization and translation, technology and translation, transcreation (creative translation), advertisement/marketing and translation, video game translation, website translation, tourism translation, quality control, community/crowdsourcing translation and fansubbing. Through concrete examples of authentic translations, this course will enable students to better understand how the new trends in translation studies can guide translation practice, and lead students to rethink the translators professional qualifications. Also included in the course are practical English'/Chinese translation exercises and translation commentaries, which can assist students in keeping abreast with the new trends and formulating appropriate translation strategies.","schedule":"Week 1: introduction\nWeek 2: N/A\nWeek 3: globalization/localization and translation  \nWeek 4: crowdsourcing transaltion (1) \nWeek 5: crowdsourcing translation (2)/fansubbing (1)\nWeek 6: fansubbing (2) \nWeek 7: N/A\nWeek 8: transcreation (creative translation) (1)\nWeek 9: transcreation (creative translation) (2) \nWeek 10 toruism translation (1)\nWeek 11: toruism translation (2)\nWeek 12: group translation project\nWeek 13: video game translation (1)\nWeek 14: video game translation (2)\nWeek 15: N/A\nWeek 16: website translation (1)\nWeek 17: website translation (2)\nWeek 18: research proposal presentation","scorePolicy":"1. attendance &amp; participation: 20%\n2. oral presentations: 30%\n3. one translation and commentary task: 10%\n4. one group translation project: 10%\n4. the final rsearch proposal (inclduing the presentation): 30%","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
