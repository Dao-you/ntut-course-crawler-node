Linear Equations \n- To understand the basic terminologies and notations of matrices and systems of linear equations, in the forms of vector equation and matrix equation.\n- Solving a system of linear equations with the Gaussian elimination: reducing a matrix to its echelon form. \n- To interpret a system of linear equations in various ways.\n- First exposure to key concepts such as linear independence and linear transformation. \n2. Matrix Algebra \n- To learn basic matrix arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication power, transpose, and inverse.\n- To summarize the concepts for systems of n linear equations in n unknowns. \n3. Vector Spaces \n- Introduction to vector spaces. \n- Fundamental subspaces of a matrix: column space, row space, and null space.\n- Basis and dimension of a vector space. \n4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n- To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. \n- Diagonalization of a matrix (linear transformation).\n5. Orthogonality and Orthogonal Bases \n- To introduce inner product of vectors, and thus the geometric concepts of length, distance, and angle (perpendicularity).\n- To be familiar with the use of orthogonal bases.\n- Least-squares approximation.","scorePolicy":"1. Attendance and warm-up quizzes (sampled and comprehensive), 10% (extra).\n2. Written exercises, 20%. Hand in your homework every Thursday right before class. \n3.
