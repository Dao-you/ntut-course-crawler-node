The course objectives include: 1.) A calculus based survey course of basic physics principles. 2.) Resolve a system of forces as they relate to the dynamics of motion. 3.) Explain Newton’s Laws of Motion and apply them in the analyses of problems. 4.) Apply the principles of motion and conduct controlled experiments. 5.) Solve problems and demonstrate the application of the scientific method.","schedule":"1.　　Introduction.\n8.　　Conservation of Mechanical Energy\n9.　　Linear Momentum\n10.　　System of Particles\n11.　　Rotation of a Rigid Body\n12.　　Angular Momentum and Statics\n13.　　Gravitation","scorePolicy":"Quizzes, Exams           : 100%","materials":"Harris Benson (2013).
