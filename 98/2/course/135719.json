We will focus on discussing how the DNA, RNA, protein or cells related with optoelectronic application.\nOptoelectronics is the study and application of electronic devices that source, detect and control light, usually considered a subfield of photonics. The light often includes invisible forms of radiation such as gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared, in addition to visible light, which is based on the quantum mechanical effects of light on semiconducting materials. A biomolecule is any organic molecule that is produced by a living organism, including large polymeric molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids as well as small molecules such as primary metabolites, secondary metabolites, and natural products. As organic molecules, biomolecules consist primarily of carbon and hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, and, to a smaller extent, phosphorus and sulfur.\n","schedule":"The course will be followed the schedule as below:\nWeek 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: The application and future of Bio-optoelectronics\nWeek 3: Bio-optoelectronics and Biosignal\nWeek 4: Bio-optoelectronics and Advanced Materials\nWeek 5: How molecularbiology related with Bio-optoelectronics - DNA, RNA\nWeek 6: How moolecularbiology related with Bio-optoelectronics - Protein\nWeek 7: Research papers sharing by students and round table discussion\nWeek 8: Research papers sharing by students and round table discussion\nWeek 9: Middle exam\n","scorePolicy":"The score will be counted as below:\nRelated papers reading and presentation 40%: every student will be given at least one chance for presentation.\n2.

A current trend in optoelectronics is the emergence of a new class of optoelectronic materials based on organic molecular. We will basic on understanding and controlling light-matter interaction at elementary particle level (atoms, single molecules, single cells, etc.), which will lead to the discovery of new effects (plasmonics, entanglement, photonic crystals, etc.), and creating the possibility for new tools and applications. For example, the reduction in the interaction length has increased by orders of magnitude the resolution for applications in life-sciences. This has allowed lowering the power levels of light injected into organisms, thus making such optical methods minimally invasive, responding to demands in life-sciences and medicine. On the other hand organic substrates are bio-compatible and therefore allow an integration of photonic processing functions with life-science applications.\nAccording to above mention, herein, we will link both knowledge of optoelectronics and Biomolecule, hopefully will broaden our students’ view of the life-sciences.\n本課程將涵蓋討論光電學之基本應用原理並結合分子生物學之知識 （諸如 脫氧核糖核酸核糖核酸 蛋白質 或細胞的基本結構介紹） 希望能更拓展學員對光電學應用的眼界本課程目標將藉由了解光電探測儀器之操作應用,光源控制,與光源種類之差異（諸如gamma射線, X-射線, UV 光,紅外線與可見光), 進而將之應用於生物分子的觀察,與生命科學應用上,範圍之廣無可界限.","schedule":"Course Schedule:\nWeek 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: The application and future of Bio-optoelectronics\nWeek 3: Bio-optoelectronics and Biosignal\nWeek 4: Bio-optoelectronics and Advanced Materials\nWeek 5: How molecularbiology related with Bio-optoelectronics - DNA, RNA\nWeek 6: How moolecularbiology related with Bio-optoelectronics - Protein\nWeek 7: Research papers sharing by students and round table discussion\nWeek 8: Research papers sharing by students and round table discussion\nWeek 9: Middle exam\nWeek 10: Biophotonics\nWeek 11: Bio-photonic detecting system- human eye\nWeek 12: Bio-inspired sensors\nWeek 13: Light-harvesting complex- phycobiliproteins\nWeek 14: Bioluminescence\nWeek 15: Applications of light in biomedical industries\nWeek 16: Bioluminescence in the Sea\nWeek 17: Squeezing light for single-molecule spectroscopy\nWeek 18: Final Report\n","scorePolicy":"Evaluation:To be announced in the class","materials":"Reference:To be annouced in the class","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
