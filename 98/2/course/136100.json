Mathematical derivations and MATLAB simulations are used to analyze and obtain the solutions to these problems.  For unconstrained optimization problems, one-dimensional search, gradient, Newton’s, conjugate direction, quasi-Newton methods are presented. For linear programming problems, simplex method is introduced. Last, Lagrange and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multipliers are presented for solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems.","schedule":"Weeks 　　Topics　　                                 Reading\n1　　Vector Spaces and Matrices　　                Text ch. 2\n2　　Transformations and Elements of Calculus   Text ch. 3,5\n3　　Basics of optimization problems　　      Text ch. 6\n4　　One-dimension search and Newton’s method  Text ch. 7,9\n5　　Gradient methods　　                         Text ch. 8\n6　　Conjugate direction method　　                Text ch. 10\n7　　Quasi-Newton methods　　                Text ch. 11\n8　　1st Mid-term　　\n9　　Least square method　　                Text ch. 12\n10　　Genetic algorithm　　                         Text ch. 14\n11　　Linear programming　　                         Text ch. 15\n12　　Simplex method　　                         Text ch. 16\n13　　Duality　　                                  Text ch. 17\n14　　Nonlinear constrained optimization　　       Text ch. 19\n15　　Lagrange multiplier 　　                Text ch. 19\n16　　KKT multiplier　　                         Text ch. 20\n17　　Convex optimization 　　                Text ch. 21\n18　　Final exam　　\n","scorePolicy":"1 mid-term examinations        30% \n2 projects                     30%\n1 final examination            40%\n","materials":"Textbook: Edwin K.
