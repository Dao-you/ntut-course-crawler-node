Project I involves a writing of analysis on educational or social issues.  Students will be guided with strategies of critical reading and structures of analysis and formal critique so as to set forth thoughtful responses and formulate a coherent thesis and support it with evidences and arguments. Project II—Reading the News—emphasizes analysis and argumentation.  After carefully examining two newspaper articles describing the similar event or issue, students will learn to read critically and write their own analysis and viewpoints.","schedule":"2/25　　Enumeration; The Old Days\n3/4　　Analysis;　　“Typical Science Fiction Film”\n3/11　　Writing an outline　　“Why Women Should Not Have an Abortion”\n3/18　　Organization of an Argumentative Essay;　　“Uniforms”\n3/25　　Debatable Statements;“College is a Waste of Time and Money”\n4/1　　Transitional Words　　Response to “College is a Waste of Time and Money”\n4/8　　TOEFL &amp; GRE argumentative sample essays\n4/15　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n4/22　　TOEFL &amp; GRE argumentative sample essays;\n4/29　　Comparison and Contrast;“Romance is a Poor Basis for Marriage”“My Part-time Jobs”;“METU and Bogazici University”;“The Committer vs. the Non-Committer”\n5/6　　Browsing through the news;“The Noose Incident”\n5/13　　Selecting a news event;“An Appropriate Expression?”\n5/20　　Comparing and Contrasting Media (Re)Presentations;　　“Ithacan Inquirer”\n5/27　　Arguing Your Point of View　　;“Now Hip-Hop, Too, Is Made in China”“Why Isn’t Hip-Hop Popular in China”\n6/4　　Arguing vs. Expressing Your Opinion\n6/11　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n6/18     Project II completed\n6/25　　Review and Discussion\n","scorePolicy":"Criteria for grading\n1.　　Project I: 35% (outline draft —10%; draft 2—10%; final draft: 15%)\n2.　　Project II: 35% (outline draft —10%; draft 2—10%; final draft: 15%)\n3.　　Assignments and In-class Practices: 30%\n","materials":"Requirements:\n1.Your regular attendance is required to pass this course.  3 unexcused absences from class will result failing grade for this course.
