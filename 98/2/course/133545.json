In the course of practicing such skills, we will take as our general topic the issue of aesthetics (the study of ideas about beauty and about art).   In light of our previous discussions about the nature of good and evil, we will consider how Western culture values art and beauty, in particular the way in which beauty has been both associated with and opposed to the good.  Our topics will include:  the differences between the good and the beautiful;  Western conceptions of beauty; the nature of creativity; the lives of artists. \n","schedule":"1　　Intro\n　　Definitions   \n\n2　　Aesthetics (intro article)　　\n\n3　　(con’t)\n\n4　　Pygmalion\n　　Wilde, “The Happy Prince”　　　　　　\n\n5　　Ruskin, “The Quarry”\n\n6　　Pater, “Introduction to The Renaissance” and “Conclusion\n\n7   　　(con’t)　　　　 \n\n8　　Wilde, Dorian Gray (excerpts)\n\n9　　MIDTERM\n\n10　　Wilde, “Critic as Artist”\n\n11　　Wilde, Quotations\n\n12　　Bell, “What is Painting?” \n\n13 　　(con’t)　　　　\n\n14　　(con’t)　　　　　　　　\n\n15　　Film:  Wilde　　　　　　　　\n\n16　　Film discussion　　　　　　\n\n17　　FINAL EXAM　　\n\n","scorePolicy":"Midterm  33.3%\nFinal　　33.3%\nQuiz　　33.3%\n","materials":"Course reader","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
