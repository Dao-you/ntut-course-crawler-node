In the course of practicing such skills, we will take as our general topic the theme of good and evil, in particular the importance of these two concepts to an understanding of the role of the hero in American culture.  Examining essays and films about the nature of good and evil, heroes and villains, we will consider why the vocabulary of the hero and the heroic is so widespread in American politics and popular culture, and what the rhetoric of good and evil tells us about Western society and its people.","schedule":"Week 1　　9/14　　course intro  (allusions[“Axis of Wrong”]; definitions)\n\nWeek 2　　9/21　　Bush 9/11 speeches\n\nWeek 3　　9/28　　　　 (continued)\n　　　　　　\n　　　　　　　　\nWeek 4　　10/5　　Reflective essays:  “Axis of Wrong”;  “Triumph of Goneril and Regan” \n\nWeek 5   　　10/12　　 　　(continued) \n\nWeek 6   　　10/19   Aristotle, The Good\n\nWeek 7 　　10/26　　Evil in Popular Culture I:  “Concept of Evil in Harry Potter” (essay)\n\nWeek 8  　　11/2　　　　(continued)\n\nWeek 9　　11/9　　MIDTERM\n\n\nWeek 10 　　11/16　　 Film:  LOTR: The Two Towers\n\nWeek 11　　11/23　　Evil in Popular Culture II:  “Evil in LOTR” (essay)\n     \nWeek 12　　11/30　　　　(continued)　　　　\n\nWeek 13   　　12/7　　  no class\n\nWeek 14 　　12/14   Auden, “The Quest”   \n\nWeek 15   　　12/21　　　　(continued)\n\nWeek 16  　　12/28　　Campbell, “The Hero’s Journey”\n\nWeek 17  　　1/4　　　　(continued)\n\n\n \n","scorePolicy":"Grades:\n　　Midterm  33.3%\n　　Final　　   33.3%\n　　Quizzes  33.3%\n\n\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\n \n","materials":"Course reader","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
