We will learn basic cinema vocabulary and grammar (for example: the Take, the Shot, the Scene), we will study some documentary films, and we will then collaboratively develop story boards and shooting schedules as we prepare to make the film.  The course will require students to develop team work, flexibility, and problem solving.  We hope to make an interview based commentary as well as a process documentary and perhaps a history documentary or some other type.\n\n本課程採工作坊方式進行，學生需將文學作品轉譯成電影成品。課程之初將擇一文學作品，仔細分析其語言、語調、風格、內涵、人物及主題，然後合力將原作改編成電影腳本，依據電影三元素: 意象、時間和聲音的準則進行拍攝。在實踐的過程中，學生需學習承擔責任與完成任務，藉此加強團隊合作和互信互助的精神，才能克服拍攝過程中的種種困難和技術問題，進而培養運用文字和語言的彈性和創意。","schedule":"Wks 1-6 Planning, filming &amp; Editing the Interview Documentary\nWks 7-12 Planning, Filming, and Editing the Process Documentary\nWks 13-17 Planning, Filming, and Editing the  History Documentary\nFinal Exam\n","scorePolicy":"Grades will be based on participation in the making of the films (75%) and a final exam (25%).","materials":"Text: selections from Film Art\n","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
