[{"name":"周素鳳","email":"sfchou@ntut.edu.tw","latestUpdate":"2009-09-11 19:56:30","objective":"In the first semester, Intermediate English Writing is specifically designed to enhance students’ ability to present a clear, concise, coherent expository essay (Project I—Recollection and Reflection) and a well-organized analysis essay with a well-articulated thesis statement, sound reasoning support and an effective conclusion (Project II—Character Analysis).  Throughout the course, students will learn to develop their writing through dialogic interactions with texts, through class discussion and other collaborative class practices, and through sequenced assignments.\nIn addition to the essays which aim to demonstrate essential writing skills, Jodi Picoult’s My Sister’s Keeper is especially selected for Project II. Students are required to compile a reading portfolio to demonstrate their progress as a close reader and reflective writer. It is hoped that through such an approach, students’ vocabulary power will be enriched, their ability in literary analysis cultivated, and their writing skill advanced.\n","schedule":"9/17　　Writer’s Block; Geeting the Main Ideas\n        “Misconceptions about Writing”\n9/24　　Finding the Topic; Topic Sentence　　“\n         Gary Larson’s Cartoon”\n         My Sister’s Keeper(pp. 1-21)\n10/1　　Active Reading; Observing\n         ”Reading a Painting”\n         M: 22-43\n10/8　　Free Association\n“Prospect Park”\nM: 44-68\n10/15　　Finding the Central Idea\n“The Match”\nM: 69-101\n10/22　　Talking about Memories\n“A Sketch of the Past”\nM: 102-117\n10/29　　Dialogue with a Text\n“Daddy Tucked…”\nM: 118-139\n11/5　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n11/12　　M: 140-196　　Project I completed\n11/19　　How to Write a Summary\n“Our Barbies, Ourselves”\nM: 197--264\n11/26　　How to Write a Paraphrase\n“An Anthropologist on Mars”\nM: 265-326\n12/3    “Cat in the Rain”\nM: 327-389\n12/10　　Analysis paper vs.Reflection paper\n“Necklace”\nM:390-423\n12/17　　Writing an Analysis\n“Story of an Hour”\nM:425-500\n12/24　　Character Analysis\nDraft of Project II\n12/31　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n1/7　　Book Review on My Sister’s Keeper\n1/14　　Review and Discussion\nProject II completed","scorePolicy":"Criteria for Grading\n1.Project I--35% : 1st draft: 10%;\n2nd draft: 10%;\nfinal draft: 15%\n2.Project II—40%: reading portfolio: 10%;\n1st draft: 10%;\nrevised draft: 20%\n3.Attendance, In class practice, Peer-reviewing and comments,\nAssignments: 25%\n","materials":"Textbooks:\n1.
