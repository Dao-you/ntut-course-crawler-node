Students are going to create 2D and 3D intelligent CAD-objects. We will not draw them. We try to describe them by arithmetic expressions, numbers and variables. Starting Point are selected graphic patterns which we try to analyse and define the specific composition rules. Like a recipe, students will write down step by step how the pattern is bulit up starting from a blank sheet.\nIn a second step students will program with the scripting language RhinoScript the investigated sets of rules. By the integration of parameters the generation of many variants in short time are possible. Changing the values leads to unexpected results.","schedule":"week 01 (09/16)  : Introduction &amp; Example of Parametric Design\nweek 02 (09/23)  : Learning RhinoScripting: Getting Started\nweek 03 (09/30)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 04 (10/07)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 05 (10/14)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 06 (10/21)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 07 (10/28)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 08 (11/04)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 09 (11/11)  : Mid-term Examination\nweek 10 (11/18)  :  Assignment01_Parametric Tower\nweek 11 (11/25)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 12 (12/02)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 13 (12/09)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 14 (12/16)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 15 (12/23)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 16 (12/30)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 17 (01/06)  : RhinoScript Tutorial\nweek 18 (01/13)  : Final Examination","scorePolicy":"學生必需每週出席到課，實作作業必需如期完成。\n作業內容及參與討論佔總成績40%，出席佔20%，學期總成果40%","materials":"RhinoScript 101","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
