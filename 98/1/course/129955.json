In the beginning of this course, digital-time signals, systems, and transforms are reviewed. Also, digital filter design including FIR and IIR filters are presented. Then, application implementation on speech, audio, and image processing is introduced. Last, labs on some DSP algorithms are performed on C28xx DSPs.","schedule":"Weeks    Topics                               Book Chapter\n1　　Introduction, basic concepts of DSP　　Chap. 1\n2　　Discrete-time linear systems 　　Chap. 2\n3　　Discrete-time linear systems 　　Chap. 2\n4　　Z-transform　　Chap. 3\n5　　Z-transform　　Chap. 3\n6　　Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT)　　Chap. 4\n7　　Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT)　　Chap. 4\n8　　Frequency selective linear filtering and sample theorem　　Chap. 5\n9　　Sampling and Reconstruction Signals　　Chap. 6\n10　　Mid-Term Exam\n11　　Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)　　Chap. 7\n12　　Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)　　Chap. 7\n13　　Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)　　Chap. 8\n14　　Implementation Discrete-Time Systems　　Chap. 9\n15　　FIR filter design　　Chap. 10\n16　　IIR filter design　　Chap. 10\n17　　Introduction of TI C28xx DSPs and their developmental tools\n18　　Final Exam\n","scorePolicy":"8 homework assignments  0%\n4~6 quizzes  30%\n1 mid-term examination  30%\n1 final project  10%\n1 final examination   30%\n","materials":"Textbook: J.
