Handouts need to include:\ni.　　Unit Precis (at least 800 words) with translation\nii.　　Definitions of key terms\niii.　　Definitions / meanings of unfamiliar lexical items\niv.　　Research Tasks (see textbook)\nHandouts are to be distributed to the class prior to the unit session except for the translation. An electronic file (on compact disc, not via email) of complete handouts will be due for submission in two weeks after the session. All submitted files need to comply with the format as instructed.\n(3)　　Each student will be given abundant opportunities to provide his/ her response toward the assigned reading content as the lectures proceed.
