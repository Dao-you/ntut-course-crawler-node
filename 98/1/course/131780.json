The solution process includes data collection and problem investigation, model formulation, optimal solution derivation, cost and efficiency analysis, system implementation and execution etc. This course mainly contains various application cases. Accordingly, participant can understand how to apply theoretical methods on solving real problems. Computational software is also utilized to solve the formulated models and analyze and interpret the obtained solutions.","schedule":"W1 Introduction to Operations Research\nW2 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\nW3 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\nW4 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\nW5 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\nW6 Simplex method\nW7 Duality and sensitivity analysis (Homework 1 due)\nW8 Duality and sensitivity analysis \nW9 Midterm exam\nW10 Goal programming\nW11 Integer linear programming: application problems\nW12 Integer linear programming: application problems\nW13 Integer linear programming: application problems\nW14 Solution algorithm for integer programming\nW15 Decision analysis\nW16 Decision analysis (Homework 2 due)\nW17 Game theory with application problems\nW18 Final exam\n","scorePolicy":"Homework: 25% \nMidterm: 30%\nFinal: 30%\nPresent situation: 15% \n","materials":"Textbook: \nHamdy A.
