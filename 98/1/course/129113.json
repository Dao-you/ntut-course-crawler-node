In the course of practicing such skills, we will follow from our reading class and take as our general topic the concept of good and evil, with a special focus on conversation as a free, improvised, exchange of ideas (as opposed to the prepared speeches required for public speaking and dramatic performances).  Our topics will include:  stories from film and books; non-fiction accounts of famous heroes and villains; narratives of our own personal journeys and conceptions of the good.  \n\n","schedule":"Week 1　　9/14　　Intro:  “good” phrases\nWeek 2　　9/21　　Ideas/expression relating to the Good (Personal Narrative)\nWeek 3　　9/28　　　　part 2\nWeek 4　　10/5　　Defining the bad: rules that should or should not be broken\nWeek 5　　10/12　　　　part 2\nWeek 6　　10/19　　Principles to Live by　　　　\nWeek 7　　10/26　　　　part 2　　　　　　　　\nWeek 8　　11/2　　20 Questions　　\nWeek 9　　11/9　　MIDTERM\nWeek 10　　11/16　　Group story　　\nWeek 11　　11/23　　Quotations: evil/devil\nWeek 12　　11/30　　　　part 2　　　　\nWeek 13　　12/7　　News report:  evil\nWeek 14　　12/14  　　　　 continued\nWeek 15　　12/21　　　　continued　　\nWeek 16　　12/28　　Film:   Fisher King\nWeek 17　　1/4　　film discussion\n\n","scorePolicy":"Grades:\n　　Midterm  　　33.3%\n　　Final  　　　　33.3%\n　　Participation  　　33.3%\n\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\n \n","materials":"Grading for midterm and final projects on will be based on criteria such as clarity, fluency, originality, and effort.\n\n\n","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
