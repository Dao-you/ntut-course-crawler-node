    "objective": "本課程屬於影像處理的進階課程，將聚焦於多光譜和高光譜影像分析與處理，並將涵蓋一般日常使用的彩色影像（多光譜影像的一種），以遙測影像與醫學影像作為主軸，分析各自不同的差異，以及所需的影像處理技術。\n課程內容將涵蓋多光譜和高光譜影像的基礎、各種影像於分析時所面臨的挑戰以及所需的影像處理技術，包括線性分解、資料降維與升維、光譜與空間上的特徵萃取、機器與深度學習演算法。\n選修本課程的學生需要具備基礎的信號處理、機率、線性代數和影像處理方面的背景。本課程將於學期初復習重要的基本概念，協助選修同學銜接本課程。\nThis is an advanced course on image processing. The main focus of this course is the analysis and processing of multispectral and hyperspectral images. It will cover the general color images as a type of multispectral image and be mainly based on remote sensing and medical images for analysis of their differences and corresponding image processing techniques.\nThe scope of this course includesfundamentals of multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, challenges in image analysis, and corresponding image processing techniques, such as linear unmixing, dimensionality reduction, spectral and spatial feature extraction, and machine/deep learning algorithms. \nStudentsare expected to have a basic background in signal processing,  probability, linear algebra, and image processing prior to taking this course. Important basic concepts will be reviewed at the beginning of the semester to help students lay the groundwork.",
