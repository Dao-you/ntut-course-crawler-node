    "objective": "半導體構裝技術是將積體電路和其它電元件，依設計聯結在一系統中，再以構裝材料將晶片、基座及釘架封包。本課程將介紹陶瓷構裝和高分子構裝、及其相關技術、與工業現況。\nSemiconductor packaging facilitates the chips be incorporated into an individual protective package, mounted with other components in hybrid or multi-chip modules, or connected directly onto a printed circuit board. This course will introduce both ceramic packaging and polymer packaging and their corresponding technology. It covers the topics in any electronic system, including electrical design for power, signal, and EMI; thermal design by conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer; thermo-mechanical failures and reliability; advanced packaging materials at micro and nano-scales; ceramic, organic, glass, and silicon substrates.",
