    "objective": "Recently, many artificial intelligence (AI), network, and embedded system application developers use Python programming language to implement their systems. However, many developers only take Python as a script language instead of using Python’s object oriented characteristics. This class will mainly start from programming Python by the object-oriented way. Students will be required to implement various kinds of assignments to learn the characteristics of Python objects. Besides, students can learn how to apply all kinds of Python application programming interfaces to understand the Python more. In the end of this class, students will be required to develop a network application containing a frond-end client and back-end server to show their achievements.",
