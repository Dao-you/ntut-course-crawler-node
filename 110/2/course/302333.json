    "objective": "本課程著重教導學生閱讀文章，並藉由文章訓練學生字彙建構、語言解析及聽力會話、思維啟發能力。課中延展活動將閱讀內容與聽力、會話、寫作做進一步的連結，並引導學生將所學做有效的應用。\nThe course provides students with explicit skills-based instruction in learning how to process, and decipher the readings that serve as springboards for reading skills development, vocabulary building, language analysis, and thought-provoking discussions. The readings include a variety of viewpoints on global topics centered around social issues, the environment, psychology, business, and technology. Extension activities are designed to encourage students to go beyond the reading text, and to put what they acquire from the readings into listening, speaking and writing practices.",
    "schedule": "We will be working through chapters 7–12 of American Headway, which I find to be a very engaging book that also clearly explains a lot of the grammatical intricacies that often trip up non-native speakers. It is no problem if you have not taken the first half of the course (so long as you can get a copy of the textbook) as the topics taught are not cumulative. \n\nWe will also read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and do many related speaking and vocabulary activities.",

The book is usually also available at Taipei Tech's temporary bookstore. \n\n2) Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Students usually enjoy reading this classic! It's a great way to improve your vocabulary, logic, understanding of the English language, and cultural knowledge (as well as your understanding of English jokes and puns.)",
