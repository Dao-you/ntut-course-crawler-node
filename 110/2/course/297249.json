    "objective": "分析化學包含物質組成的分離，確認與測定。定性分析旨在化學確認物質之物種，定量分析則在測定其含量。分離操作步驟在定性與定量分析中通常是必要的.\nAnalytical chemistry involes separating, identifying, and determining the relative amounts of the components in a sample of matter. Qualitative analysis is concerned with the chemical identify of the species in the sample and quantitative analysis is concerned with to mearsure the relative amounts of the components in a sample.A separation step is usually a necessary part of both a qualitative and a quantitative analysis.",
