    "objective": "西方文化的交流是建立在故事上的。即使這些故事相當久遠，但每個人卻都非常熟悉，又或者是因為這些故事相當久遠，所以每個人都非常熟悉。本課程將探討近代主要西方作家 — 喬瑟及莎士比亞 — 作品中的核心主題及文化的意象。研讀這些近代西方主要作家的作品是發展西方文學素養及思想的基石，同時，也為任何概括了以西方文化為主體的研究提供了不可或缺的背景知識。\nConversation in Western culture is built on stories. Everybody knows the stories even though the stories are very old, or rather everybody knows them because they are very old stories. This course introduces students to some of the stories that have been most influential in the English-speaking world. Knowing these stories provides essential background knowledge for understanding Western culture in general.",
