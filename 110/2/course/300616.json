    "objective": "‘Statistics’ is the art of using data to make appropriate (sometimes, best!) conjectures about problems encountered. This course is a calculus-based introduction to statistics, and so designed to help students learn the introductory descriptive and inferential statistical procedures that are used in diverse areas. Mainly, this course deals with the basic concepts of statistical inference and linear models. After a review of descriptive statistics and some necessary probability distributions, interval and point estimation, hypothesis tests, linear regression analysis, ANOVA, and factorial designs are illustrated and accompanied by practical/theoretical exercises.",
