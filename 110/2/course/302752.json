    "objective": "The purpose of this course is to understand the fundamental wave theory which describes how light propagates in the form of waves. During the 3-hour weekly practicals, we will be working in small teams on exercises and exploring some simulation tool to help with the material in the lectures. For example, we will introduce a sophisticated tool for studying the propagation of light, transmission of light through a medium, polarization, interference of waves and diffraction.",
