    "objective": "In this course, both the theoretical background and programming techniques of deep learning are introduced. Different neural network structures for deep learning including feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, deep reinforcement learning neural networks, and their applications are introduced. Structure design, parametric tuning, and generalization capability of deep learning are also investigated.",
