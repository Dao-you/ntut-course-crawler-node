    "objective": "This course is an introduction to statistical computing and will be taught in Minitab. Minitab is widely used not only in engineering, but also in sciences, medicine, biology, physics, and business. It is assumed students have exposure to basic statistics and knowledge of calculus (i.e., differential and integral calculus). The main focus of the class will be on statistical analysis and graphics in Minitab. Students will cover basic statistical concepts and various statistical methods such as estimation, hypothesis tests, regression analysis, ANOVA, and factorial designs.",
