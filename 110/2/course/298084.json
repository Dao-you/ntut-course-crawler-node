    "objective": "This course is designed as the precursor courses selected by seniors and graduate students. It covers the basic knowledge of the atmospheric boundary layer, bluff-body aerodynamics, aero-elasticity, the wind-resistant design of buildings, and the concept of wind-resistant design of bridges. National and international wind codes for buildings and bridges are introduced with the practices based on wind tunnel test data.",
