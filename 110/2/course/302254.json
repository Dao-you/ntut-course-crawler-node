    "objective": "Data structures play an important role in computer science and can make the program or systems work efficiently in terms of time and space. This course introduces the fundamental structures and some advanced ones, including arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, maps and dictionaries, hash tables, trees and graphs, as well as priority queues. In addition, the analysis tools and design issues for data structures will be discussed.\n\nFor any inquiry, please use the following contact information:\nEmails: cmliu@ntut.edu.tw( school); 11107@cc.ntut.edu.tw (Microsoft Teams)\nLine ID: mobile.prof\nFB: facebook.com/howard.liu.5\nPhone: 4251 (in school)",
