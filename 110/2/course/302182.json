    "objective": "The reliability analysis technique is a quantitative analysis tool for evaluating the influence of uncertain factors. Engineer reliability is an important index for evaluating engineering design results. Engineering reliability analysis provides necessary information for risk analyses and risk decisions. To facilitate students' understanding of the theoretical background, techniques, and engineering application of reliability analysis, this course reviews and introduces corresponding probability and statistic theories, reliability analysis techniques, limit state design approach, and risk analysis.",
