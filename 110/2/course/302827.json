    "objective": "This is a project-based course to learn how to use computer software to aid engineering design. Students will form groups and choose a topic to design a mechanical device. Each group will have several presentations in the semester, which includes mechanical device selection, motivation, motion requirements, CAD drawing for the design, troubleshooting, and the simulation results. At the end of the semester, it is required to turn in a formal report that concludes the progress and the difficulties in the semesters.",
    "schedule": "Subjects:\n　　Motion requirements of designing mechanisms.\n　　Methodology of synthesizing linkages.\n　　Computer aid design review.\n　　Computer aid design project.\n　　Motion simulations.\n　　Force analysis and static simulations.\n　　Dynamic simulations\n\nBecause the instructor provides the design method and guides the students during the design process, the instructor of this course owns part of the copyright of the works that students developed.",
    "scorePolicy": "Project presentation: 50%\nAssignments and Quizzes:20% \nFinal report: 30%",
