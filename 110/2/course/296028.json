    "objective": "The purpose of this course is to apply the key concepts of automatic control and instrumentation to process plants. Material and energy balances are used to model unsteady state (dynamic) process systems where control algorithms are required to bring the process back to equilibrium. Laplace Transforms are used as a means to conveniently solve ordinary differential equations, which are used when describing process control systems. Control loops are developed to represent industrial processes enabling appropriate control approaches to be elucidated. Commonly used sensing, transmission and final control elements are described . At the end of the course, the students will have an appreciation of the fundamental importance of control systems for the safe and sustainable operation of process plants.",
