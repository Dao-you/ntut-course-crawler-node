    "objective": "本課程幫助學生習得敘述、描寫、推論、議論、省思、說明等文體方面的寫作技巧，並指導學生從閱讀、圖片、日常生活事件，及課堂討論內容中取材，以加強邏輯思考和流暢寫作能力。\nThis course aims to develop and reinforce students' strengths to create unified and coherent pieces of composition in a variety of styles--narrative, descriptive,  argumentative, reflective, and expository.  Students will be guided to write in response to readings, pictures, events in their daily lives, and discussions from the class.  Thought-provoking topics dealing with current issues are used to stimulate and foster critical writing strategies. This course enables students to write and discuss logically and clearly; they also need to incorporate grammatically newly-built vocabulary into their writing.",
