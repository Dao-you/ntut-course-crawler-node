    "objective": "This course aims to improve the understanding of students in computer simulation methods. Students will learn to re-examine their own research results in a different aspect using computational simulation. Students will need to formulate research tasks for their own research projects.\n\nAll courses will be recorded and documented in the Youtube Playlist:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8heLgO8UqyPA-RAJ9h0a_ZOGmPVbvl_A",
    "schedule": "1. Introduction of molecular/computer simulations in engineering and the tools for this course. (1 wk)\n2. Computer programming (online course, 2wk) \n3. Exam for basic programming skills (1 wk)\n4. Simulation workshop -- the friction problem (4 wks) | Introduction for modeling, force field, trajectory analysis, and visualization\n5. Literature survey for computer simulation papers (1 wk)\n6. Use open-source simulation packages for your research (1 wk)\n7. Course project -- perform simulation for your own research topic (6 wk)\n8. Formulate a simulation-based proposal (1 wk)",
