    "objective": "This course targets at the color derived from a variety of physical and chemical mechanisms are summarized. Includes vibrations and simple excitations to explain the colors of incandescence (e.g., flames), gas excitations (neon tube, aurora), and vibrations and rotations (blue ice and water). And also chemical structure, manufacturing and properties of main dyes and pigments are studied. Further applications of the color stuff are explained.",
