    "objective": "This is a course on the practical aspects of optimization methodology, with a major focus on using the most popular CAE techniques ANSYS and stratagems relevant to engineering applications arising in design, operations, and analysis. Attention is given primarily to techniques applicable to problems in continuous variables that involve real-valued constraint functions and a single real-valued objective function. \n\nIn short, we will teach not only the concept and applications of engineering optimization; but also how to use it along with ANSYS to develop some very practical models under specific constrains, such as optimal design of a dental implant.",
