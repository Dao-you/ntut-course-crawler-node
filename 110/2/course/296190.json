    "objective": "Most human settlements were close to rivers. Therefore, modifying river channels to reduce the chance and magnitude of floods has been the main focus of conventional ways to tame rivers. However, the traditional ways of cementing river channels destroy natural habitats and are not aesthetically pleasing. Fluvial ecological engineering is a new field, which achieves the purposes of flood prevention, landscaping, recreation, and ecological conservation by using natural materials and following natural hydrological trends of rivers. The course will first introduce the evolution of river engineering throughout history. Because ecological engineering has to conform with the natural trend of river evolving, principles of fluvial geomorphology will be then introduced in the class. After students have these basic understandings, the course will continue on introductions of concepts, methods, and procedures. Field cases of fluvial ecological engineering in Taiwan as well as other\ncountries will be introduced to students.",
