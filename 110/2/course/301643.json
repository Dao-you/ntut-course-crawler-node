    "objective": "This course is mainly based on three fundamental principles of crystal diffractometry, microscopy, and spectroscopy; and aims to illustrate the characterization techniques of crystal structure, microstructure, and chemical composition inside and on the surface of solid materials. Exploring precision, accuracy, and high resolution of modern science and technology, this course gradually analyzes X-ray diffractometer, various optical and electron microscopy, scanning probe microscope, AES, XPS, SIMS, NMR, all kinds of spectrometers, as well as other analytical instruments such as thermal analysis, synchrotron radiation and neutron analyses. Special application case studies and discussions are provided to enhance the understanding of advanced and novel materials so that students can know well and fully utilize a variety of important materials analysis technique and their principles, methodology, and proper applications.",
