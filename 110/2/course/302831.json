    "objective": "本課程強調邏輯與批判性思考能力，並提出有說服力之論點，例如討論如何增加銷量、政府通過之法律是否公平、或者什麼是最好的電影。本課程探討邏輯和理性論證所需的條件。學生將學習如何識別其他人提出的好（和壞）論點，以及如何構建和組織自己的邏輯論述。本課程幫助學生練習批判性思維技能，藉由一系列實踐主題，包括新聞、政治、科學、倫理、藝術和娛樂。\nEvery day at work and in our free time we need to use logic and think critically in order to make persuasive arguments. We argue about how to increase sales, about the fairness or unfairness of laws passed by the government, and about what the best movie is. This course examines what is required for a logical and rational argument. Students study how to identify good (and bad) arguments made by other people and how to structure and organize logical arguments of their own. The class helps students to practice their critical thinking skills across a range of practical subjects, including the news, politics, science, ethics, art and entertainment.",
