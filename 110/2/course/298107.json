    "objective": "This course will teach the knowledge-based control methods, mainly focuses on Fuzzy logic control and Gray system (and neural network if time is available).  The Fuzzy method includes Fuzzy Logic theory and Fuzzy Logic Control.  \nFrom this course, students can understand Fuzzy theory and can apply FLC and Grey in mechanical, electrical, or vehicle systems.  The topics covered in this lecture include: fuzzy set, membership function, fuzzification / defuzzification, fuzzy reasoning and inference, FLC design, FLC applications, grey theory, grey prediction, gray modeling, and grey control (and neural-network if time is available).  This lecture needs all students to do a 2- or 3-person team project to design and implement a fuzzy logic control to a real system.  Before the core lessons, a review of system dynamics will be provided.",
