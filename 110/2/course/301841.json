    "objective": "The major goal of this class aims to give students basic 3d modeling and rendering techniques meanwhile help them to have abilities to realize the design from concept to final output. In the class we will provide the tutorial of 3d coat and blender. 3d coat is a powerful tool for advanced digital sculpting which has been applied in many different industries . Through practicing the commands and techniques with multiple exercises and practices, students will have general understanding about how the software works meanwhile get the fundamental abilities to get into design industries.\n  Student will be asked to finish a complete conceptual design project in the end of semester, it should be drawings, renderings, animations and one 3d model included. Students’ learning outcome must be showed in this package and will be the critical criteria of semester grading. \n\n本課程旨在培養學生對 3d 電腦軟體的基本能力，進而能實現心中的設計構想。課程教授的軟體將以 Rhino 與 Grasshopper 為主，讓學子熟悉這套簡單易懂的 3d 軟體在設計上的廣泛應用：透過實際繪製各色造型物件的練習，讓學子理解拆模分析與建模指令，有助於銜接進階 3d 動畫、數位製造以及基本圖像編程等進階訓練；並輔以 Lumion，讓學生們能具備基本的渲染軟體的操作與後製技術；課程最終期許能養成學生於設計界應有的基本 2D、3D 呈現與表現的能力。",
