    "objective": "This course aims to introduce the configuration of system analysis and water resources system.  Secondly, it elaborate the theoretical bases and operation procedures of common deterministic mathematical programming methods (linear programming, dynamic programming and nonlinear programming).  Finally, several water resources systems based on the characteristics of surface water, reservoirs and cities will be depicted and perform the optimal and most effective planning, development, management and operation of water resources (including water quantity and water quality).\nObjectives:\n(1)To understand concepts and algorithms for optimization using linear, integer, network, nonlinear, and dynamic programming;\n(2)To understand the concepts of optimization as applied to water resources problems.",
