    "objective": "British and American Fiction is a fascinating and inexhaustible subject. The British novels we are reading (Jane Eyre [1847], Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland [1865], Dracula [1897], and 1984 [1949]), are books that people in Britain or the U.S. would be nearly as likely to pick up for fun as they would be to read them in a class. They’re also books that almost everyone knows something about—even if individuals haven’t read the book. Knowing these books and the context they came out of will give you the ability to understand many ideas that are central to British and American identity and culture.  \n\nThrough informal investigations and in-class activities, you will learn the literary and historical context of the novel in each era. How has prose fiction changed over time? How has the purpose of writing changed? How have tastes changed? And why are these changes important?     \n\n\n本課程旨在引導學生如何以批評的角度閱讀小說。課程討論有兩個重點：（一）小說的技巧：如情節、結構、人物塑造、敘事者與敘事策略、背景鋪陳、象徵與意象等。（二）小說與文學理論的關係：如何將文學理論運用到小說的閱讀與分析。\nThis course will introduce students to critical approaches and principles in the study of fiction.  We will discuss such features as plot, structure, characterization, narrator, narrative strategy, setting, symbol, image, etc..  We will also examine various theoretical approaches that can be brought to bear on the study of fiction.  There will be a particular emphasis on the application of theories to hone students' critical reading skills.",
    "schedule": "Please see the syllabus on the first day of class for the exact reading schedule. We will proceed chronologically, starting with Jane Eyre and the Alice (we will read the latter aloud in class) and proceeding through Dracula (which will start aloud and continue on our own) and 1984. We will also read a few American short stories in class (in order to cover the American side of the fiction), but the reading load should be quite manageable for English major students. I have also taught motivated advanced non-majors.",
