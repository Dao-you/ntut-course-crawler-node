    "objective": "The course introduces the properties of signals and systems, and is a fundamental course for those who are interested in communications, signal processing, control systems, and electronic circuits. The student will learn about the basic concepts of continuous-time and discrete-time signal processing. The covered topics are:\n\n1. Signals and systems\n2. Linear time-invariant systems\n3. Fourier series representation of periodic signals\n4. The continuous-time Fourier transform\n5. The discrete-time Fourier transform\n6. Sampling\n7. Time and frequency characterization of signals and systems \n8. The Z-transform (optional)\n9. The Laplace-transform (optional)",
