    "objective": "This course deals with management accounting and control both within a micro-behavioural and within an organisational theory perspective. The aim is to provide an understanding of the developments in management accounting and control theory and practice and the implications of critical variables that affect the design, development and operation of management accounting and control systems. Practical aspects of management accounting are mainly examined through computer assisted learning (CAL). Students are expected to cover the prescribed reading on their own, and to perceive the taught seminars as the opportunity to ask questions and to offer their views at any time.",
