    "objective": "This is an undergraduate course in linear algebra for students of engineering, science, and mathematics. Linear algebra is the study of linear systems of equations, vector spaces, and linear transformations. Solving systems of linear equations is a basic tool of many mathematical procedures used for solving problems in science and engineering. In this class we will concentrate on the mathematical theory and methods of linear algebra. The student will become competent in solving linear equations, performing matrix algebra, calculating determinants, and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. On the theoretical side, the student will come to understand a matrix as a linear transformations relative to a basis of a vector space.",
