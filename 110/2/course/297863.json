    "objective": "This course teaches the analysis and design of mixed-signal ICs. This course focus on the analysis of signal conversion and system modeling. Material covered will integrate the four key facets MLDS to analyze and design an intelligent MX circuit. (1) Modeling - building MX circuit  (2) Language - utilizatin of verilog-A, verilog-D, Python, C or Matlab(3) Data - characterization of the circuit performance (4) System - adaptive algorithm for optimization. The example circuits comprises voltage regulator, PLL and SAR ADC.",
