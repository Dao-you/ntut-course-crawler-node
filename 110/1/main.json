It, however, was a reciprocal process. Not only are architects and architectural theorists becoming more close to ideas of cultural theory, but in great numbers of cultural theorists, philosophers and sociologists are to be found highly engaged with questions of architecture and the built environment. Yet, in recent, it is found that architects and students of architecture may confront struggling to deeply navigate those thinkers’ work resulting in unexpected distances and hazes between disciplines. Therefore, there are two intentions to form this module. Firstly, it attempts to introduce architecture to a broader cultural context, and to consider how debates from cultural theory might begin to inform a discussion about architecture (Leach 1997).
