[{"name":"王聖銘","email":"ryan5885@gmail.com","latestUpdate":"2021-09-02 22:00:30","objective":"As the internet has grown and become pervasive in our lives, the world has gotten smaller. More and more, as consumers, we can share our experiences. For a company, great experiences can be a competitive advantage. They can keep your customers loyal and turn them into your biggest cheerleaders. On the flip side, terrible experiences can stop you in your tracks very quickly. No one wants to be that company being talked about for all the wrong reasons. Building great user experiences requires listening and empathy. In this course, you’ll learn the tools and techniques to make your design/products delightful for users.\nThis course is an introduction to User Experience with a focus on Space, Product, and Interaction Design. Students create a complete UX brief, from ideation to annotated wireframes that could be handed off to a developer to be built. They will also learn to conduct the research necessary and create all the supporting documentation required to defend their design decisions. There is a large focus on how to dissect and analyze common design patterns.\nThis class is an interdisciplinary integration course. The majority of students are design college students looking to transition their skills into digital, or product managers looking to improve their design skills. Other students often include engineers who want to learn how to make their design/products more usable and entrepreneurs looking to build out the user experience for their idea.\nOverall, this course will cover the fundamentals of user experience design and provide the students with insights into the measurement of user research. The real-life processes, challenges, considerations, tools, team works, models, and case studies of user research are introduced in this course by lecturing, discussing, and practicing methods. Students are expecting to learn user experience principles, to designing, evaluating, implementing, and measuring user experience in both qualitative and quantitative methods in the aspect of interaction design, space design, and product design individually\n本課程主要將由設計學院互動設計王聖銘老師授課，並將邀請國內使用者經驗研究與服務設計的研究學者與業界專家，透過專題演講的方式協同授課。王聖銘老師兼具建築與城鄉規劃、互動技術及資訊科學跨領域的背景，目前研究的主軸為人機互動、服務設計以及使用者經驗科學性驗證。課程中將包含使用者經驗設計的基礎，以及使用者研究量測的內涵及方法。本課程中，將透過課堂上課、討論、以及實習的方式，介紹使用者研究的實際案例、評估模式、團隊合作方法、設計與評估工具、實踐思維、挑戰、以及實際執行的程序。預期學生將於本課程中，透過分組獲得使用者經驗在互動設計、空間設計以及產品設計上，有關使用者研究的設計、評估、施行、以及質化與量化分析量測評估的知識與方法。本課程也將協助修課之博碩士班學生，組織、整理並撰寫可投稿研討會或期刊之論文。","schedule":"Unit 1: Principles and Process（第一單元：原理與步驟）\nIntroduction to UX（使用者經驗概論）\n　　Describe the field of UX and how it relates to other disciplines\n　　Outline the stages in the UX process\n　　Identify the structure and purpose of various design deliverables\nUser Research and Personas（使用者研究與人物誌整理）\n　　Write a questionnaire\n　　Interview users in context\n　　Identify User Centered Design techniques\n　　Create effective personas to define the users one is trying to reach\nUX Analysis（使用者經驗分析）\n　　Ask questions that discover key business needs\n　　Describe the benefits to an MVP approach\n　　Given a goal, identify the tasks for a user to complete that goal and draw the user flow\n　　Given a problem and a determined feature set, use a competitive audit to determine if there are different ways to implement the feature\n　　Prioritize features based on essentialness and level of effort\nUnit 2: UX Toolkit and Measurement（第二單元：使用者經驗分析與量測工具）\nCreating Wireframes and Prototypes（架構與雛型的建構）\n　　Identify and describe tools for wireframing, prototyping, advanced drawing, and creating clickable drawings\n　　Create wireframes, clickable drawings, and prototypes\nUsability Principles and Testing（易用性評估原理與測試）\n　　Evaluate user experience of given websites and products, using Jakob Nielsen's 5 Principles of Usability（易用性的五大原則）\n　　Define each type of usability test and determine when to use each\n　　Run a usability test using best practices\nUser Experience Measurement（使用者經驗量測）\n　　Measuring user experience by participant observation\n　　Eye tracking basic, applications and implementation on user experience analysis\n　　Using Electroencephalography (EEG) in a usability test of a survey\n　　Scientific data analysis and big data analysis\nUnit 3: Practices for Design Patterns（第三單元：設計實務）註：依修課學生之研究領域選擇\nInteraction Design in Spatial Planning（空間規劃之互動設計）\nProduct Service System User Survey（產品設計系統使用者調查）\nService Design of Interaction Technology（互動技術之服務設計）\nSocial Network Experiences Design and Evaluation（社群網絡之經驗設計與評估）","scorePolicy":"Participation  課程參與　　20%\nProject I  　　專案一 10%\nProject II  專案二　　10%\nMidTerm Project  期中專案成果 　　20%\nTerm Project and Paper  期末專案成果與論文　　40%","materials":"1.　　Research Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Available as free PDF from http://usability.gov/guidelines/guidelines_book.pdf\n2.　　Moggridge, B, Designing interactions, MIT press, (2007).
