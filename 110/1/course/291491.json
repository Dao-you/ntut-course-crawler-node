Part 1: A major object of this course is to provide a background in fiber compositions, synthesis, spinning and characterization. A second goal is to introduce factors that influence fiber compositions, formation and properties and their testing. Part 2: The course interprets the following subjects, such as: (1) Morphology of the fibers. (2) Microstructure and macrostructure of fibers. (3) Staple fiber length and cross-section. (4) Fiber density and absorption. (5) Mechanical properties. (6) Optical properties. (7) Thermal properties. (8) Fiber Viscoelasticity. (9) Electrical properties etc and their testing.","schedule":"1. Cotton 2 weeks\n2. Jute 1/2 week\n3. Wool 1 week\n4. Silk 1/2 week\n5. Rayon 1 week\n6. Acetate 1/2 week\n7. PET 1 and 1/2 weeks\n8.
