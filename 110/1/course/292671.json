    "objective": "Programming has become one of the \"essential literacy\" in recent years. While not each student, especially a literature/English major, is required to be a programming expert, a basic understanding of computational thinking would be beneficial.\n\nIn this course, we pick front-end development as our entry point to the vast possibilities of programming. We will introduce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The most important reason for the choice is front-end development provide immediate feedback, which is helpful for beginners. Secondly, the potential applicability is no doubt: a web page is the most frequently-used medium to communicate ideas, and many human-computer interactions still happen on web pages. Thirdly, although primarily used in web pages, JavaScript has become more and more omnipotent in every aspect. Moreover, JavaScript is a great language. Although it starts as a front-end scripting language, it learns a lot from other successful paradigms. \n\nThis course will gradually introduce how to talk about things with programming language in the context of HTML, and how to change their appearances (states) with CSS. Afterward, we will cover basic programming concepts, such as variables, conditionals, loops, data structures, modules, etc in Javascript. The course is organized as an one-hour lecture and an one-hour hand-on lab session. Students are expected to follow the course requirements, including participation, assignments, mid-term exams and a final project.\n\n## Objectives\n\nUpon successful completion of the course, students will know how to build a complete web page and have a basic understanding on programming and JavaScript.\n\nThe course also serves as a window through which students can find their way into more advanced and interesting aspects of programming.",
