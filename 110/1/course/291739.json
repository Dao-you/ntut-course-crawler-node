      "lv2Description": "The laboratory has 24 benches, and can have students work in sufficient social distance from each other. So experiments are still done in the laboratory in case of COVID-19 Level 2 Alert. In the worst case of Level 3 Alert the instructor will perform experiment in the laboratory and students attend the class on-line. Then students send their reports by emails for grading. ",
      "courseScoreMethod": "All experiment reports should be prepared electronically, and submit to the instructor by emails to present spreading of COVID virus. In the case of Level 1 and Level 2 Alert students will fill in their mid-term and final exams in paper.",
