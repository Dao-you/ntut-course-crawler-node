These processes and technologies ultimately further the development of products that may involve living (cells and/or tissues) and nonliving (bio-supportive proteins, scaffolds) components. The course introduces students to cell printing, patterning, assembling, 3D scaffold fabrication, cell/tissue-on-chips as a coherent micro-/nano-fabrication toolkit. Real-world examples illustrate how to apply biofabrication techniques in areas such as regenerative medicine, pharmaceuticals and tissue engineering.","schedule":"Topic 1: Overview introduction of biofabrication\nTopic 2:  Mechanical perspectives in biofabrication\nTopic 3: Software for Biofabrication\nTopic 4: Design and quality control for 3D-biofabricated scaffolds\nTopic 5:  In Vivo and In Situ biofabrication by laser-assisted bioprinting\nTopic 6: Stereolithographic 3D biofabrication for biomedical applications\nTopic 7: Recent progress on biofabricated cartilage, Blood Vessels and skin\nTopic 8: Direct and indirect biofabrication of organ construct\nTopic 9: Biofabrication of artificial bone and teeth","scorePolicy":"Oral presentation 30%\nReport on literature review and research proposal writing (30%)\nProject (40%)","materials":"Essentials of 3D Biofabrication and Translation","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
