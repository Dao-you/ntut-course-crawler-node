Moreover, this class is to provide the students with experience in modeling the theory and applications for optical system design, using commonly used software tools such as MATLABR and COMSOL. Student will also learn more system design such as the solar dish receiver and laser system from professional specialist faculties from Pitotech.","schedule":"1st week：Opening and Meeting\n2nd week：Ray Propagation in an Inhomogeneous Medium\n3rd week：Ray optics by ABCD matrix (MATLA&amp;COMSOL) \n4th week：Aberrations\n5th-6th week：Solar dish receiver (by Pitotech)\n7th week：Wave Optics and Maxwell's Equations\n8th week：Gaussian Beam Optics (MATLAB&amp;COMSOL)\n9th ~10th week: Midterm Exam (COMSOL)\n11th~12th week：Laser system (by Pitotech)\n13th~14th week：Final project preparation\n15th -16th week：Final project presentation","scorePolicy":"Midterm presentation 25%\nFinal project presentation 25%\nHomework: 30%\nProgramming Quiz: 20%","materials":"Optics (4th Edition)  by Eugene Hecht","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
