Consequently, these skills will provide the student with a basis to conduct their own such analyzes and to evaluate critically others’ uses of statistics.","schedule":"Week 1 Introduction to statistics, data Summary, and presentation\nWeek 2 Probability, Bayesian theorem, correlation\nWeek 3 Random variables and probability distributions – Random variables, probability\nWeek 4 Random variables and probability distributions – Continuous random variables\nWeek 5 Random variables and probability distributions – Discrete random variables\nWeek 6 Decision making for a single sample – Estimation, hypothesis testing\nWeek 7 Decision making for a single sample – Inference on the mean of a population\nWeek 8 Quiz, independent Study\nWeek 9 Midterm exam (In-class, 1 Cheat Sheet, Calculator)\nWeek 10 Decision making for a single sample – Inference on the variance of a normal population\nWeek 11 Decision making for a single sample – Inference on a population proportion, goodness of fit test\nWeek 12 Decision making for two samples – Inference on the means of two populations (Part I)\nWeek 13 Decision making for two samples – Inference on the means of two populations (Part II)\nWeek 14 Decision making for two samples – Paired t-test, inference on the ratio of variances of two normal populations\nWeek 15 Decision making for two samples – Inference on two population proportions\nWeek 16 Building Empirical Models – Simple Linear Regression\nWeek 17 Quiz, independent Study\nWeek 18 Final exam","scorePolicy":"Midterm Exam: 30 %\nFinal Exam: 30 %\nQuiz: 35 %\nAttendance: 5%","materials":"Engineering Statistics (5th Ed., Wiley) by Montgomery, Runger, and Hubele (ISBN: 978-0-324-59433-1)","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true,"remarks":"\n<b>本學期課程因應疫情警戒等級規劃上課方式原則如下，實際實施日期與上課方式，請依照學校網頁所公布之訊息為準：\n\n※「一級」警戒：實體授課。\n\n※「三級」(含)以上警戒：課程全採遠距授課。\n\n※「二級」警戒授課方式說明如下：</b>\n\n<b>●上課方式：</b>遠距上課\n\n<div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\"> </div>\n\n<b>●評量方式：</b><div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\">Online exam and quiz</div><hr>\n<b>如果學期初就實施遠距教學或分流上課，本課程所採行之因應方式：</b>\n\n<b>●課程訊息公告：</b>\n<div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\">i-school system, MS teams</div>\n\n<b>●上課網址：</b><div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\">i-school system, MS teams, Email</div>\n\n<b>●學生加退選簽核及諮詢課程問題管道：</b>\n<div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\">i-school system, MS teams, Email</div><hr>\n<b>●補充說明資訊：</b><div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\"></div>\n\n  "}]
