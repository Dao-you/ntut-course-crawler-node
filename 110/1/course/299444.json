In addition, this course teaches students learn how to protect the managed network or information system to against from being compromised successfully. The course will be supplemented by practices, and teaching students how to use the existing tools to scan and test the security of the system. In order to protect the security of the system, the course will focus on the system and network practices, which can let the students feel the possible network and system attacks.","schedule":"Part One: The IoT Threat Landscape\nChapter 1: The IoT Security World\nChapter 2: Threat Modeling\nChapter 3: A Security Testing Methodology\n\nPart Two: Network Hacking\nChapter 4: Network Assessments\nChapter 5: Analyzing Network Protocols\nChapter 6: Exploiting Zero-configuration Networking\n\nPart Three: Hardware Hacking\nChapter 7: UART, JTAG, and SWD Exploitation\nChapter 8: Hacking SPI and I2C\nChapter 9: Firmware Hacking","scorePolicy":"Assignments 40%\nFinal report 40%\nInteraction 20%","materials":"Practical IoT Hacking\nThe Definitive Guide to Attacking the Internet of Things\nby Fotios Chantzis, Ioannis Stais, Paulino Calderon, Evangelos Deirmentzoglou, Beau Woods\nMarch 2021, 464 pp.\nISBN-13: \n978171850090","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true,"covid19":{"lv2Description":null,"courseScoreMethod":"Assignments 40%\nFinal report 40%\nInteraction 20%","courseInfo":"none","courseURL":"none","contactInfo":"none","additionalInfo":"none","lv2Method":"遠距上課"}}]
