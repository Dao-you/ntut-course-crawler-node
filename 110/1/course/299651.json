It is concerned that how reliable communication can be achieved and what is the capacity a channel can provide. Much attention will be focused on the newly developed technology, referred to as multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) transmission.\nCourse outline:\n1.The Wireless Channel \n2.Diversity\n3.Capacity of Wireless Channels\n4.MIMO I: Spatial Multiplexing \n5.MIMO II: Capacity and Multiplexing Architectures\n6.MIMO III: Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff\n7.MIMO IV: Multiuser Communication","schedule":"(subject to change based on class progress)\nWeek 1: Introduction.\nWeek 2: Linear Algebra and Matrix Computations (Review).\nWeek 3: Linear Algebra and Matrix Computations (Review).\nWeek 4: Linear Algebra and Matrix Computations (Review).\nWeek 5: Single-Antenna Wireless Communications. \nWeek 6: Single-Antenna Wireless Communications. \nWeek 7: Single-Antenna Wireless Communications. \nWeek 8: Midterm I.\nWeek 9: Spatial Multiplexing and Receiver Design.\nWeek 10: Spatial Multiplexing and Receiver Design.\nWeek 11: Spatial Multiplexing and Receiver Design.\nWeek 12: Space-Time Coding\nWeek 13: Space-Time Coding\nWeek 14: Midterm II.\nWeek 15-16: Other MIMO Transceivers (Optional)\nWeek 17-18: Final Project.","scorePolicy":"Quizzes: 30%\nMidterm I: 20%\nMidterm II: 20%\nFinal Project: 30% (can be in Chinese/English)","materials":"1.
