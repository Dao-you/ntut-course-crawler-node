A special emphasis on bioreaction engineering and more industrial chemistry with real reactors and real reactions will be covered and wide range of applications to which chemical reaction engineering principles will be applied.","schedule":"Review of Chemical Kinetics (第一~八週）\nMid-term exam（第九週）\nCatalysis and Calytic Reactions（第十、十一、十二週）\nNonisothermal Reactor Design（第十三、十四、十五週）\nDiffusion and Reaction（第十六、十七週）\nFinal exam（第十八週）","scorePolicy":"1.上課表現/作業繳交/出缺席 20%\n2. 2次小考 (各20%)\n3. 期中考 20%\n4. 期末報告/考 20%","materials":"1.
