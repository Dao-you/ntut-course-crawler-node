Specifically in this course we will discuss basic probability theory and its use as a basis for inferential statistics, discuss efficient decision-making techniques, and develop ability in the use of available software (e.g., R) for decision-making analysis. By the end of the course, you will understand the decision-making process, be able to use decision analysis techniques, and make better (sometimes best!) decisions systematically.","schedule":"Week 1 Introduction to data analysis for decision-making\nWeek 2 Basic statistics Part I: Random variables, mean, median, standard deviation, variance, correlation, covariance\nWeek 3 Basic statistics Part II: Random variables, mean, median, standard deviation, variance, correlation, covariance \nWeek 4 Basic statistics Part III: Hypothesis tests\nWeek 5 Basic statistics Part IV: Hypothesis tests\nWeek 6 Simple linear regression – Part I\nWeek 7 Simple linear regression – Part II\nWeek 8 Simple linear regression – Part III\nWeek 9 Interim presentation of individual project and submission of interim report\nWeek 10 Multiple linear regression – Part I\nWeek 11 Multiple linear regression – Part II\nWeek 12 Multiple linear regression – Part III\nWeek 13 Paper discussion – Part I\nWeek 14 Paper discussion – Part II\nWeek 15 Paper discussion – Part III\nWeek 16 Presentation I\nWeek 17 Presentation II\nWeek 18 Presentation III","scorePolicy":"1.
