This course will introduce the healthy building and environment that between human health and the built environment and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Different factors in a building affect its safety and hygiene. The factors such as lighting, quality of air, thermal comfort, aural comfort, colors, mind, movement, water , Nourishment ,materials ,and community are known to have a positive relationship with a healthy built environment.\nThe course will be conducted in the following main topics.\n\nA. Air Quality：To achieve high levels of air quality across a building’s lifetime through diverse strategies that include source elimination or reduction, active and passive building design and operation strategies and human behavior interventions.\n\nB. Materials: to reduce human exposure, whether direct or through environmental contamination, to chemicals that may impact health during the construction, remodeling, furnishing and operation of buildings.\n\nC. Thermal Comfort：To promote human productivity and provide a maximum level of thermal comfort among all building users through improved HVAC system design and control and by meeting individual thermal preferences.\n\nD. Light : create lighting environments that promote visual, mental and biological health.\n\nE. Sound : the identification and mitigation of acoustical comfort parameters that shape occupant experiences in the built environment.\n\nF. Movement and Fitness: promotes physical activity in everyday life through environmental design, policies and programs to ensure that movement opportunities are integrated into the fabric of our culture, buildings and communities.\n\nG.mind: promotes mental health through policy, program and design strategies that seek to address the diverse factors that influence cognitive and emotional well-being.\n\nH.Water : All aspects of the quality, distribution and control of liquid water in buildings.","schedule":"1.
