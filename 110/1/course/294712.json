Regardless what types of the recent emerging field of interaction design such as UI, UX, responsive website, tangible interaction design, or smart environment, the image remains as the visual language for design ideation to realization. This course introduces the concept of digital pipeline which is mediated on wide range of image related digital technologies. Through those modularized technologies, we can form a working pipeline to create a prototype for an interaction design proposal.","schedule":"1. Design &amp; Visual Language\n2.
