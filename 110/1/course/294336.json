The term \"tissue engineering\" has been coined to describe the interdisciplinary field concerned with the study of generation or regeneration of tissues. Researchers in this area utilize knowledge of the molecular basis of cellular function and interactions, in combination with fundamental engineering principles, to gain insights into tissue structure and function, with the purpose of developing bioartificial tissues or enhancing native tissue function.","schedule":"Tissue Engineering\n\nWeek 1　　　　Introduction\nWeek 2　　　　Introduction\nWeek 3　　　　Stem Cell\nWeek 4　　　　Stem Cell\nWeek 5　　　　Stem Cell\nWeek 6　　　　Cell Signaling\nWeek 7　　　　Cell Signaling\nWeek 8　　　　Extracellular Matrix and Cell Junction\nWeek 9　　　　Cell Adhesion\nWeek 10　　　　Cell Adhesion\nWeek 11　　　　Midterm test\nWeek 12　　　　Extra cellular matrix\nWeek 13　　　　Biopolymer\nWeek 14　　　　Scaffold &amp; 3D-printing\nWeek 15　　　　Bioreactor\nWeek 16　　　　Surface modification\nWeek 17　　　　Surface modification\nWeek 18　　　　Fianl test","scorePolicy":"1.
