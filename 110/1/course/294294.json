    "objective": "Brushless dc and permanent-magnet synchronous motor have higher efficiency and energy to mass ratio in comparison to the other motors. They are gradually replacing induction motor and widely used in industry. This course begins with the theory of basic electromagnetic energy conversion, followed by the modeling and vector control theory for permanent-magnet synchronous motor, design and control of brushless dc motors, and the driving circuit design for these motors. Finally, sensorless PM machine control techniques are introduced.",
