The goal of this course is to get familiar with the building blocks of electrical systems in Mechatronic applications. Major topics include Electrical machines, Motor Drives, Power Amplifiers, Power Electronics, and OP-Amp related signal processing circuits. Lectures are given to illustrate the function of the each block in electrical systems. And then the students can conduct experiment to explore relevant circuits in order to obtain thorough understanding of their characteristics.","schedule":"第1週: 1.
