The goal of this course is to get familiar with the building blocks of electrical systems in Mechatronic applications. Major topics include Electrical machines, Motor Drives, Power Amplifiers, Power Electronics, and OP-Amp related signal processing circuits. Lectures are given to illustrate the function of the each block in electrical systems. And then the students can conduct experiment to explore relevant circuits in order to obtain thorough understanding of their characteristics.","schedule":"第1週: Class begins;\n第2週: Preview of electrical systems; \n第3週: Preview of experiments: Motor and Drive Diagnosis\n第4週: Influences of sensor positions in motor detection;\n第5週: Relationship between unbalance and vibration in motor;\n第6週: Effects of lubrication to stability of motor running; Effects of loadings to motor running;\n第7週: Dynamic balance, loosening, and axial bending of motor;\n第8週: Measuring temperature of motor in operation.\n第9週:  Midterm examination\n第10週: Basics Principles for Electric Machine Analysis; Direct-Current Machines; Experiments: Reference-Frame Theory;\n第11週: Symmetrical Induction Machines; Synchronous Machines; Theory of Brushless dc Machines;\n第12週: Machine Equations in Operational Impedances and Time Constants; Linearized Machine Equations; Reduced-Order Machine Equations;\n第13週: Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical 2-Phase Induction Machines; Semi-controlled Bridge Converters; Dc Machine Drives;\n第14週: Fully Controlled 3-Phase Bridge Converters; Induction Motor Drives; Brushless dc Motor Drives;\n第15週: Presentations of group I;\n第16週: Presentations of group II;\n第17週:.
