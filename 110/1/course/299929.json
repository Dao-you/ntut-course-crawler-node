In the class we will provide the tutorial of Rhino and Lumion. Both of them are the most useful tools for interior design and have been widely used in different practices. Through practicing the commands and techniques with multiple exercises and practices, students will have general understanding about how the software works meanwhile get the fundamental abilities to get into design industries.\n  Student will be asked to finish a complete conceptual design project in the end of semester, it should be drawings, renderings, animations and one 3d model included. Students’ learning outcome must be showed in this package and will be the critical criteria of semester grading. \n\n本課程旨在培養學生對3d電腦軟體的基本能力，進而能實現心中的設計構想。課程教授的軟體將以Rhino與Grasshopper為主，讓學子熟悉這套簡單易懂的3d軟體在設計上的廣泛應用:透過實際繪製各色造型物件的練習，讓學子理解拆模分析與建模指令，有助於銜接進階3d動畫、數位製造以及基本圖像編程等進階訓練；並輔以Lumion，讓學生們能具備基本的渲染軟體的操作與後製技術；課程最終期許能養成學生於設計界應有的基本2D、3D呈現與表現的能力。","schedule":"Lesson01: Introduction of the class.\n\nLesson02: \n1.　　Introduction of Rhino Interface.\n2.　　Basic Setting of the Rhino.\n3.　　Types of Modeling.\n4.　　Basic commands…(Sweep1, Revolve…etc).\n\nLesson03: \n1.　　Basic commands…(Sweep2, Extrude…etc).\n2.　　Case1 Practice.\n\n\nLesson04: \n1.　　Basic commands…(Loft, blend).\n2.　　Case2 Practice.\n\nLesson05: \n1.　　Basic commands…(deformation…etc).\n2.　　Case3 Practice.\n\nLesson06: \n3.　　Basic commands…(section tool, camera setting…etc).\n4.　　Case4 Practice.\n\nMidterm.\n\nLesson08: \n1.　　advanced commands(flow,etc).\n2.　　Case5 Practice.\n\nLesson09: \n1.　　advanced command(deformation,etc).\n2.　　Case5 Practice\n\nLesson10: \n1.　　advanced commands(Grasshopper)\n2.　　Case6 Practice\n\nLesson11: \n1.　　Project Practice.\n2.　　Project management.\n3.　　Render in Rhino\n\nLesson12: \n1.　　Project Practice.\n2.　　Render technique in Rhino.\n\nLesson13: \n6.　　Intro of Lumion.\n7.　　Rhino file exchange.\n\nLesson14: \n8.　　Material setting in Lumion.\n9.　　Filter setting in Lumion.\n10.　　Render setting in Lumion.\n11.　　Animation setting in Lumion.\n\nLesson15: \nPostproduction tutorial.\n\nLesson16: \nPostproduction tutorial.\n\nLesson17: \nFinal.Group presentation.\n\nLesson18: \nFinal.Group presentation.","scorePolicy":"Attendance and Interaction in class 30%\nMidterm 30%\nFinal Project 40%","materials":"講師自編教學檔案與講義  Online handout: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_3wVQFHVlasuHlZ3Yr5zS731eNGYBRge\n\n講師自編教學影片 Online Tutorial: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_3wVQFHVlasuHlZ3Yr5zS731eNGYBRge","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false,"covid19":{"lv2Description":null,"courseScoreMethod":"For midterm  it will be an online examination, for the finals it will be online presentation.","courseInfo":"Please join this FB teaching group.
