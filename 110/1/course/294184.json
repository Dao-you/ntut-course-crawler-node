    "objective": "本課程介紹如何將電化學技術應用於生物燃料電池上。生物燃料電池的觸媒主要是由酵素或是微生物甚至是生物細胞所組成，反應過程區分為電子直接轉移 (mediatorless) 與間接轉移 (mediator)，並介紹此各種生物燃料電池的原理及應用，個別討論電池之反應過程、電池電極材料、電化學修飾電極及各種不同電池電解質溶液等個別元件。\nThe aim and purpose of this course is to introduce and expand the electrochemistry to develop the biofuel cells. Generally the catalysts of biofuel cell are composed by enzymes, microbial, creature cells and the bio-reduction process. In the biofuel cells the reaction process can be distinguished into mediator less and mediator transfer process. In this course, we will introduce the principle, reaction process and the application of biofuel cells. Especially, a detailed study about the utilization of film modified electrodes and different electrolyte solutions for the development of biofuel cells.",
