    "objective": "The aim and purpose of this course is to introduce and expand the electrochemistry to develop the biofuel cells. Generally the catalysts of biofuel cell are composed by enzymes, microbial, creature cells and the bio-reduction process. In the biofuel cells the reaction process can be distinguished into mediator less and mediator transfer process. In this course, we will introduce the principle, reaction process and the application of biofuel cells. Especially, a detailed study about the utilization of film modified electrodes and different electrolyte solutions for the development of biofuel cells.",
