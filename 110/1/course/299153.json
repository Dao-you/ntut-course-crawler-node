The methods for solving the decision-making models include: linear programming, integer programming, nonlinear programming, hierarchical analysis process and network process etc. The course content is mainly based on case illustrations such that students can understand how the theory is combined with practical problems. Therefore, various practical application problems in engineering and management will be used to explain the models. Optimization software and decision-making tools will be used to solve the problems and assist in explaining the management implications of the obtained data, and perform model cost-benefit analysis.","schedule":"W1 Introduction to quantitative management decision-making models\nW2 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\nW3 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\nW4 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\nW5 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\nW6 Simplex method\nW7 Duality and sensitivity analysis (Homework 1 due)\nW8 Goal programming \nW9 Integer linear programming: application problems\nW10 Integer linear programming: application problems \nW11 Integer linear programming: application problems \nW12 Midterm exam \nW13 Decision analysis \nW14 Decision analysis (Homework 2 due)\nW15 Game theory with application problems\nW16 Presentation &amp; paper discussion\nW17 Presentation &amp; paper discussion \nW18 Presentation &amp; paper discussion","scorePolicy":"Homework: 15% \nMidterm: 35%\nPaper presentation: 35%(Papers selected from Journal: INFOR, MS, OR, EJOR, C&amp;OR…)\nPresent situation: 15% (No more than three absences)","materials":"Textbook:\nHamdy A.
