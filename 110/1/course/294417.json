    "objective": "本課程通過理論介紹虛擬實境（Virtual Reality, VR）的概念與應用範圍，接續將3D環境建構的方法導入實踐操作，再透過專題設定進行內容創作，最終完成研究驗證的工作。課程目的是訓練學生在VR空間展示與設計研究端的流程，諸如3D環境設計、VR空間與內容建構、VR內容輸出與展示等能力。最終，學生可基於這些能力應用於各種虛擬空間的展示設計。\nIn this course, I will introduce the concept and scope of application of Virtual Reality (VR) via the theory, and then introduce the method of 3D environment construction into practical operation. Furthermore, this course will be showed how to creates content through a thematic setting, and finally completes the work of research and verification. The purpose of the course is to train students in the process of VR space display and design research, such as 3D environment design, VR space and content construction, VR content output, and display capabilities. Finally, students can apply these abilities to the display design of various virtual spaces.",
