Students will be offered a variety of discussion which stimulates the kinds of critical thinking that lead to a better understanding of the process of transposition from literature to film.\n\nThe course follows the history of Western literature, approaching representative literary works from Classical antiquity, Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Romantic Period and the nineteenth century, to the modern time. Students will watch films related to or adapted from the literary texts, after which the instructor will give a lecture and conduct in-class discussion. By the end of the semester, the students will be familiarized with the key ideas of each important literary era or movement and formulate their own critical interpretations of literature and its visualization.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction to the course\n\nWeek 2-3: Greek Mythology\nFilm viewing: Troy (2004)\nLiterary text: Homer's The Iliad\n\nWeek 4-6: Shakespeare and Renaissance literature\nFilm viewing: Shakespeare in Love (1998)\nLiterary text: William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and sonnets (18, 73, 116, 138)\n\nWeek 7-8: the Enlightenment and Revolution\nFIlm viewing: Quills (2000)\nLiterary text: Marquis de Sade's Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue\n\nWeek 9: Mid-term exam (Identifications and short answers)\n\nWeek 10-12: Romanticism\nFilm viewing: Byron (2003)\nLiterary text: A selection of Romantic poetry\n\nWeek 13-15: Mystery fiction\nFilm viewing: Episodes from Sherlock (2011)\nLiterary text: Conan Doyle’s stories\n\nWeek 16-17: The monstrous and modern horror \nFilm viewing: Alien (1979) or The Silence of the Lamb (1991)\nCritical essay: to be decided\n\nWeek 18: Group presentations","scorePolicy":"Attendance and participation: 20%\nMid-term: 20%\nGroup presentation: 30%\nFinal paper: 30%","materials":"Reading materials will be distributed by the instructor.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
