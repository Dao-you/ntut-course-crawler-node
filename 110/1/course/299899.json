    "objective": "This course introduces students to the environmental aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology. We will study the fundamental physical-chemical properties, synthesis and characterization, environmental implications, health and environmental impact, and environmental applications of nanoparticles and nanomaterials. Topics about the generation, collection, and measurement of nano-particle will also be covered. Case studies from recent publications on engineered carbon nanomaterials and nanomaterials on catalysis will be discussed.",
