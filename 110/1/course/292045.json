    "objective": "An introduction to probability theory and mathematical statistics that emphasizes the probabilistic foundations required to understand probability models and statistical methods. Topics covered will include the probability axioms, basic combinatorics, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, mathematical expectation, common families of probability distributions, the central limit theorem, inferential statistics, and some useful statistical methods. The course objectives are to enable students having the ability to\n□　　Summarize and present data; \n□　　Describe probability distributions and compute probabilities; \n□　　Conduct point and interval estimation; \n□　　Make inference about populations; \n□　　Apply these concepts in practice with emphasis on engineering applications, engineering design, decision making and management sciences.",
