Most examples taught in this class are based on the TensorFlow framework. We will cover many different fields including image classification, object detection, natural language processing, reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks. The syllabus is listed as follows:\n•　　Number and Character recognition\n•　　Image Classification for 1000 categories\n•　　Object Detection for 9000 objects\n•　　Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n•　　Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n•　　Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n•　　Transformer, BERT, and GPT-3\n•　　Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n•　　Deep Reinforcement Learning","schedule":"1.
