It provides the framework, elements, and resources for a “conversation” to take place between users and design.\n In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of interfaces and the interaction design process. Students will be introduced to and have opportunity to practice the fundamental concepts, methods, and practices of interaction design. They will explore the ideas of \"User Experience Observation \", \"Form Follows Function\" and \"User Interaction Analysis and Evaluation\". They will explore how interactive media create experiences, and understand the role that interaction with contents and installment fulfills in human existence. Finally and most importantly, students need to learn how to improve their ability to present their design ideas.\nThis is a class with time devoted to lecture, discussion, practice activities, design work sessions, and critique of practical work. \n\n\nCourse Objectives/Goals: \nAt the conclusion of the course, students will be able to: \n1.　　Identify how increasingly complex technologies are integrated into designs, services and events. \n2.　　Define how digital or physical artifacts behave in response to user-centric interaction. \n3.　　Describe, test and evaluate the usability and sustainability of user interfaces. \n4.　　Apply iterative cycles of research, testing and development based on the understanding of user needs, goals and experiences. \n5.　　Develop solutions and processes to common or known interface problems. \n6.　　Build and test rapid prototypes for look and feel and usability. \n7.　　Utilize client based concept development to develop the strategy, information architecture, human-computer interaction and interface design. \n8.　　Demonstrate competency in information architecture, human-computer interaction and interface design.","schedule":"W1.　　What is Interaction Design\nW2.　　Evolution of HCI in Interactive Media Design (Assignment: Project I Content with HTML5 and CSS) \nW3.　　Understanding and Conceptualizing Interaction and Information Visualization \nW4.　　Understanding Users and What is User Experience\nW5.　　Project I Presentation and Critique (Assignment: Project II Mobile Device UI)\nW6.　　Responsive and Natural UI Design\nW7.　　Designing for Collaboration and Communication \nW8.　　Project II Presentation and Critique (Assignment: Midterm Project Proposal Draft)\nW9.　　Service Design I, Brainstorming, POG and SET (Assignment: Midterm Project Proposal Final) \nW10.　　Service Design II, QFD, AHP, and Data Gathering\nW11.　　Midterm Project Presentation, Judge and Critique \nW12.　　Data Analysis, Interpretation and Presentation (Assignment: Term Project and Paper I)\nW13.　　The Process of Interaction Design (Assignment: Term Project and Paper II)\nW14.　　Identifying Needs, Establishing Requirements, Designing, Prototyping, and Construction \nW15.　　Introducing Evaluation and  Evaluation Framework\nW16.　　Term Project and Paper Presentation and Critique I\nW17.　　Term Project and Paper Presentation and Critique II\nW18.　　Final Exam and Term Paper and Project Submission","scorePolicy":"Participation 　　20%\nProject I HTML 5 and CSS 　　10%\nProject II MOBILE UI 　　10%\nMidTerm Project  　　15%\nTerm Project and Paper TANGIBLE 　　35%\nFinal Exam 10%","materials":"1.　　Moggridge, B, Designing interactions, MIT press, (2007).
