    "objective": "每天許多人規律運動、觀賞及討論賽事，若具備暢談體育以及運動相關俚語的英文能力，將十分有益於與英語人士交流。本課程將介紹學生適用於體育以及其他社交場合的英語單字（包含許多用於職場專業場合、不同於字面意思的運動俚語）。本課程能幫助學生更清楚地理解英語體育新聞、更周全地與英語人士談論體育、用更加批判性的思維來思考運動在英語世界的文化、語言、日常生活中扮演著怎樣重要的角色。\nBecause many people play, watch, and discuss sports every day, being able to talk about sports and to understand sports idioms is very helpful when interacting with English speakers. This course introduces students to English vocabulary that is useful for talking about sports, but also useful in other social situations. (For example, many sports idioms -- such as “to play hardball” and “to strike out” -- are used by businessmen in professional situations not directly related to sports).  The class helps students to understand more clearly English news about sports, to talk more thoughtfully with English speakers about sports, and to think more critically about the important role that sports play in the culture, language, and everyday life of people in the English-speaking world.",
