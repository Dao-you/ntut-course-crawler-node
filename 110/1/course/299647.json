The object of this course is to teach how to apply the C programming language to develop real application systems. The contents of this course include advanced pointer usage, pointer and array, pointer and data structure, pointer-to-pointer, function pointer, callback functions, bitwise operations, and so on. In addition to practice on PC, this course also offers case studies for better understanding. Students will also be required to implement emulators to simulate OS lower level operations, e.g., CPU scheduling and memory management.","schedule":"Week 1: C review\nWeek 2: Pointer and array\nWeek 3: Pointer and structure\nWeek 4: Linked list applications\nWeek 5: Linked list applications\nWeek 6: Linked list applications\nWeek 7: Linked list applications \nWeek 8: Preprocessor/makefile\nWeek 9: Pointer to pointer applications\nWeek 10: Pointer to pointer applications\nWeek 11: Function pointer and callback function\nWeek 12: Declarations\nWeek 13: Declarations\nWeek 14: Bitwise operations\nWeek 15: Applications to memory management\nWeek 16: Graph \nWeek 17: Graph \nWeek 18: Hashing","scorePolicy":"In class program quiz: 100%","materials":"Slides (will announce every week)","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false,"remarks":"\n<b>本學期課程因應疫情警戒等級規劃上課方式原則如下，實際實施日期與上課方式，請依照學校網頁所公布之訊息為準：\n\n※「一級」警戒：實體授課。\n\n※「三級」(含)以上警戒：課程全採遠距授課。\n\n※「二級」警戒授課方式說明如下：</b>\n\n<b>●上課方式：</b>遠距上課\n\n<div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\"> </div>\n\n<b>●評量方式：</b><div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\">Evaluations can be deliver through the NTUT iSchool +</div><hr>\n<b>如果學期初就實施遠距教學或分流上課，本課程所採行之因應方式：</b>\n\n<b>●課程訊息公告：</b>\n<div style=\"background:transparent;color: blue;font-size:12pt\">I will teach in the class, and students can participate in class or on-line (depend on students' choose).
