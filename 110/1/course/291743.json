To acquire basic knowledge of the old-fashioned analog communication systems, including AM, FM, and PM. To have good knowledge of digital communication systems, including PAM, PSK, and QAM.\n\nPrerequisite：If you have completed the course “Signals and Systems”, this course will be easier for you. If not, you can still take this course, but you have to work harder at the first 1/3 of the course.","schedule":"1. Fourier Transform (Spectrum) &amp; Filters (3 weeks, Chapter 2)\n2.
