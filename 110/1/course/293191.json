The objective of this course is to provide knowledge and skill in advanced techniques of hydrological data analysis, modeling and prediction.  The course will involve both the use of probabilistic techniques and physical principles to characterize hydrologic processes and hands on computer practices.  Such analyses are characterized by data collection, analysis and interpretation, simulation, and forecasting.","schedule":"1.statistical hydrology and frequency analysis\n2.precipitation and design storm\n3.losses from precipitation\n4.time of concentration\n5.rainfall –runoff computation\n6.channel routing\n7.reservoir routing\n8.TR-20 model practice\n9.HEC-RAS model practice (if time permits)","scorePolicy":"homeworks：33%\nmidterm exam：33%\nfinal exam (or modeling project)：34%","materials":"1.經濟部水資源局、台大生工系(2001). 水文設計應用手冊, 經濟部水利署台北辦公區.\n2.McCuen, R.
