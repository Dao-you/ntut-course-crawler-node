Marketing research is the process of harnessing the Internet data and putting the data to meaningful use. Marketing research provides a link between the consumer and public, through information that is used to identify and define marketing opportunities and problems, to initiate marketing action, and to improve marketing performance. This module aims to provide students with an understanding of the methods used in digital marketing research, and their roles in supporting marketing decisions. The module addresses the stages of the digital marketing research process, from identification of the problems and definition of the research objectives, to the presentation, visualisation and interpretation of research findings.","schedule":"1　　Introduction to marketing research\n2　　Quantitative Methods I - Experiment Part A\n3　　Quantitative Methods II - Experiment Part B\n4　　Example paper discussion – Experimental method [Presentation I]\n5　　Quantitative Methods III - Survey Part A\n6　　Quantitative Methods IV - Survey Part B\n7　　Quantitative Methods V - Survey Part C\n8　　Mid-term exam week (no class)\n9　　Example paper discussion – Survey method [Presentation II]\n10　　Qualitative methods I - Projective Techniques\n11　　Qualitative methods II - Interview and Diary studies\n12　　Qualitative methods III - Coding\n13　　Example paper discussion – Qualitative method [Presentation III]\n14　　Mixed Method\n15　　Discussing findings, drawing recommendations and conclusions writing the research report","scorePolicy":"Group video presentation (30%)\nIn-class group exam (open book, administered on computer; 3 hours) (40%)\nIndividual report (30%)","materials":"Sponder, M. and Khan, G.
