Methods of advanced fluid dynamics in the analysis of boundary layer theory in practical cases will also be explored. Topics such as the Navier-Stokes equation, energy equations, boundary layers and separation, mass conservation, dimensional analysis, circulation and vorticity, turbulence flow, swirling flow, advanced flow measurements and their corresponding industrial applications will be discussed.   Prospective students need to have a prior understanding of the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and its applications.  A better understanding of advanced fluid mechanics can be beneficial to a student’s future career whether in industry or academic research.","schedule":"Conservation equations for viscous fluids. \nBoundary layer theory.　　 \nboundary layer concept and Laminar boundary layer equations.   \nNavier-Stokes equations.  \nConstitutive relations and the Navier-Stokes equation for Newtonian fluids. 　　\nAnalytical solutions of the transient and steady Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous flows.\nVon Karman momentum integral equation.  \nTheory of stability of laminar flows.   \nIntroduction to turbulent flow.　　\nStability and transition to turbulence.  \nDerivation of RANS equations; turbulent shear flows.\nSwirling flow. 　　\nReynolds transport theorem.　　\nCompressible Flows.\nAdvanced flow measurements","scorePolicy":"Homework 30%\nClass participation 10%\nPresentation 10%\nMidterm exam 20%\nFinal exam 30%","materials":"Advanced Fluid Mechanics, W.
