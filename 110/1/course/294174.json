Spectroscopy methods include ultraviolet, visible, infrared, nuclear magnetic, and x-ray spectroscopies.Election and mass spectrometry are also included. Separation methods are: gas, liquid, and gel chromatographies. In addition, GC-MS,LC-MS, GC-IR, etc. will be studied.","schedule":"Raman spectroscopy - Raman scattering - stoke's and anti stokes lines - instrumentation - differences between IR and Raman spectroscopy - mutual exclusion principle - applications - structural diagnosis.\n\nUV- Visible spectroscopy - Absorbtion laws - calculations involving Beer - lambert's law - instrumentation - spectrophotometer - block diagrams with description of components - theory - factors governing absorbtion maximum and intensity\n\nInfrared spectroscopy - principle - types of stretching and bending vibrations - vibrational frequencies - instrumentation - block diagram - source - detector and recorders \n\nChromatography techniques -Principles adsorption, thin layer, partition and paper. chromatography column chromatography - and applications.
