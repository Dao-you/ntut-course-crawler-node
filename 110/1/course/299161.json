    "objective": "This course introduces to the methods essential to business research. The first focus is on applied quantitative statistical analysis—interpreting results, as well as applying them on actual data. Students should become informed consumers of statistics—to be able to understand and assess the quality of statistical methods in the papers you read, and to use those methods in your own research. The second focus is on research design and data collection methods, which will be essential to masters’ dissertation, as well as practical business roles (such as consultant or market researcher). Students will participate in a project in which they have the chance to collect and analyze their own data.\n\nThe course is on fundamentals, up to multiple regression, so we will not have time to discuss more advanced statistical techniques. However, you should leave this class with a solid foundation for further education on these topics.",
