The first focus is on applied quantitative statistical analysis—interpreting results, as well as applying them on actual data. Students should become informed consumers of statistics—to be able to understand and assess the quality of statistical methods in the papers you read, and to use those methods in your own research. The second focus is on research design and data collection methods, which will be essential to masters’ dissertation, as well as practical business roles (such as consultant or market researcher). Students will participate in a project in which they have the chance to collect and analyze their own data.\n\nThe course is on fundamentals, up to multiple regression, so we will not have time to discuss more advanced statistical techniques. However, you should leave this class with a solid foundation for further education on these topics.","schedule":"Introduction\n1.　　The Role of Business Research\n\nUnderstanding Data Analysis Methods\n2.　　Measurement, scaling, descriptive and univariate statistics\n3.　　Bivariate Statistical Analysis: Differences between 2 Variables\n4.　　Bivariate Statistical Analysis: Measures of Association\n\nData Collection Methods\n5.　　Experimental Research\n6.　　Questionnaire Design\n7.　　Attitude Measurement\n8.　　Research design presentation\n9.　　Exam week\n\nResearch Design\n10.　　Research Design\n\nApplying Data Analysis Methods with software\n11.　　Important data and basic commands\n12.　　Univariate Analysis\n13.　　Bivariate Analysis\n14.　　Regression and ANOVA\n15.　　Research analysis presentation\n\nAdditional topics\n16.　　Sampling and sample size \n　　Sampling Design and Sampling Procedures\n　　Determination of Sample Size\n\n17.　　Fieldwork and qualitative approaches\n　　Survey Research: An Overview\n　　Survey Research: Communicating with Respondents\n　　Observation Methods\n　　Fieldwork\n\n18.　　Exam week (final report)","scorePolicy":"20% Participation, homework, quizzes\n25% Group presentation\n10% Assignment 1: Research question\n10% Assignment 2: Questionnaire design\n35% Individual report presentation\n100% Total","materials":"Business Research Methods, 9th Edition\nAuthor　　William Zikmund, Barry J.
