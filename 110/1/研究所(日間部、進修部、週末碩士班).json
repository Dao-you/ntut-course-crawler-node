ESG is a performance indicator that measures the operation of an enterprise, that is, the investment standard referenced by the market. Therefore, ESG principles focusing on environmental sustainability, social responsibility and corporate governance have become a global trend. It is also the key to determining whether a corporation can successfully receive orders in the future, and it is also the lifeblood of maintaining the sustainable development of the company in the industry supply-chain.
