    "objective": "Human-Computer Interaction Design: Autumn 2023 - Syllabus\nMeeting Times and Location: Wednesday, periods: 2-4, \nCredit Hours: 3.0\nInstructors: Ryan Sheng-Ming Wang\nInstructor Office Location and Hours: Room 705-2, Design College bldg., \nWednesday, 1300-1500: and Thursday 1300-1700.\nInstructor Contact Information: E-mail: ryan5885@mail.ntut.edu.tw\n\nCourse Description: \n\"Human-Computer Interaction Design\" blends theoretical and practical perspectives in visualization and interactivity into several focused aspects using interactivity for education, entertainment, interactive media design, and industrial design purposes. \nAn interface is a link between a user and a design that communicates how a design will be used, creating an experience for the people who will use it. It provides the framework, elements, and resources for a “conversation” between users and design.\nThis course will explore the fundamentals of interfaces and the human-computer interaction design process. Students will be introduced to and able to practice the fundamental concepts, methods, and human-computer interaction design practices. They will explore the ideas of \"User Experience Observation \", \"Form Follows Function,\" and \"User Interaction Analysis and Evaluation\". They will explore how interactive media create experiences and understand the role that interaction with contents and installment fulfills in human existence. Finally and most importantly, students need to learn how to improve their ability to present their design ideas.\nThis class is devoted to lectures, discussions, practice activities, design work sessions, and critiques of practical work. \n\n\nCourse Objectives/Goals: \nAt the conclusion of the course, students will be able to: \n1.\tIdentify how increasingly complex technologies are integrated into designs, services and events. \n2.\tDefine how digital or physical artifacts behave in response to user-centric interaction. \n3.\tDescribe, test and evaluate the usability and sustainability of user interfaces. \n4.\tApply iterative cycles of research, testing and development based on the understanding of user needs, goals and experiences. \n5.\tDevelop solutions and processes to common or known interface problems. \n6.\tBuild and test rapid prototypes for look and feel and usability. \n7.\tUtilize client based concept development to develop the strategy, information architecture, human-computer interaction and interface design. \n8.\tDemonstrate competency in information architecture, human-computer interaction and interface design.",
    "schedule": "This course is focused on introducing the knowledge of human-computer interaction (HCI) design and accompanying design practice. This will allow students to understand the process of user interface design and related applications so as to be capable of practical interface design. The contents include conceptual model, interface usability, HCI process, user requirements, interface prototyping, principles of interface design, and user testing. The course is preceded by means of lecturing, case study, and practical work and evaluated by students' reports, oral presentations and design work\nW1.\tWhat is Interaction Design\nW2.\tEvolution of HCI in Interactive Media Design (Assignment: Project I Content with HTML5 and CSS) \nW3.\tUnderstanding and Conceptualizing Interaction and Information Visualization \nW4.\tUnderstanding Users and What is User Experience\nW5.\tProject I Presentation and Critique (Assignment: Project II Mobile Device UI)\nW6.\tResponsive and Natural UI Design\nW7.\tDesigning for Collaboration and Communication \nW8.\tProject II Presentation and Critique (Assignment: Midterm Project Proposal Draft)\nW9.\tService Design I, Brainstorming, POG and SET (Assignment: Midterm Project Proposal Final) \nW10.\tService Design II, QFD, AHP, and Data Gathering\nW11.\tMidterm Project Presentation, Judge and Critique \nW12.\tData Analysis, Interpretation and Presentation (Assignment: Term Project and Paper I)\nW13.\tThe Process of Interaction Design (Assignment: Term Project and Paper II)\nW14.\tIdentifying Needs, Establishing Requirements, Designing, Prototyping, and Construction \nW15.\tIntroducing Evaluation and  Evaluation Framework\nW16.\tTerm Project and Paper Presentation and Critique I\nW17.\tTerm Project and Paper Presentation and Critique II\nW18.\tFinal Exam and Term Paper and Project Submission",
