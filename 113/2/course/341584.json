    "objective": "The course will be started from the review of senior high school chemistry. Then, the modern quantum chemistry will be introduced to make students familiarized the modern chemistry approach on the interpretation of the physical chemistry phenomena in material and biological science. This includes the introduction to quantum world, Schrodinger equation, chemical bonding, molecular shape and structure and so on. Later, the thermodynamics be applied to the interpretation of  physical and chemical equilibrium, acids and bases, aqueous equilibrium and electrochemistry.",
