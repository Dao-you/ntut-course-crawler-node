    "objective": "This course aims to study basic and advanced topics in information theory. The course focuses on the concept of information theory,  including entropy, source coding, channel capacity, rate distortion theory, and differential entropy, ...etc. The calculation of channel capacity and rate distortion will be used as computer projects for real implementation. Advanced topics will further cover Gaussian channel and some coding theory.",
