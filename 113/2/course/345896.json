    "objective": "The course aims to learn how digital images are practiced in real-world applications, especially in medical images and computer vision.\nThis class will introduce the image's composition, image adjustment, composition, and even feature extraction for radiomics to apply to image detection and recognition. We will introduce some popular image processing algorithms about image processing and implement them in medical imaging projects.",
