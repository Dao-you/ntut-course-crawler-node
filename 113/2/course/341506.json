    "objective": "This course is an introductory course designed to provide undergraduate students with a foundation in the fundamental principles of chemistry. This course covers atomic and molecular structure, chemical reactions, stoichiometry, thermochemistry, the physical state of matter, thermodynamics, and kinetics. In the course, students will explore the properties of matter, the behavior of elements and compounds, and the laws governing chemical reactions. They will also develop an understanding of the scientific method and the role of experimentation in the study of chemistry. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the principles and concepts of chemistry since General Chemistry is a prerequisite for many higher-level courses in chemistry.",
