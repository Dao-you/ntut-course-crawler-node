    "objective": "Nanomaterials are materials with a single unit small sized between 1 and 100 nm.  They have unique optical, electronic, thermo-physical or mechanical properties. Since some nanomaterials have properties of enzyme-like characteristics.They are artificial enzyme, which can be used for many applications in such as biosensing, bioimaging, tumor diagnosis and so on.  We will also discuss about the safety issues, regulation and public percpetin on nanomaterials. \nStudents are expected to learn the types, the basic theory, unique properties of nanomaterials, the syntehsis and characterization of nanomaterials. This class is for upper level undergraduate students, with interested on material science and nanotechnology.",
