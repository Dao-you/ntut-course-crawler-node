    "objective": "Nanomaterials are materials with a single unit small sized between 1 and 100 nm.  They have unique optical, electronic, thermo-physical or mechanical properties. Since some nanomaterials have properties of enzyme-like characteristics, they can act as artificial enzyme, which can be used for many applications such as biosensing, bioimaging, tumor diagnosis and so on.  \nStudents are expected to learn the different types of nanomaterials, unique properties of nanomaterials, the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials. This class is for upper level undergraduate students, with interested on material science and nanotechnology.",
