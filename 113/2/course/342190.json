    "objective": "Granular material flows commonly occur in many industrial applications and nature hazards, such as fluidized beds, additive manufacturing, and debris avalanche. To provide a comprehensive understanding of granular materials flows, this course will be divided into three parts. First, we will explore the fundamental flow characteristics of granular materials and their rheological models. Next, we will examine simulation techniques for granular material flows, focusing on discrete element method (DEM). Finally, we will introduce the two-phase suspension system, followed by an exploration of practical industrial and geophysical applications of these complex flows.",
