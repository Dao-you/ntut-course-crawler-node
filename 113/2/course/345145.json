    "objective": "The course of Digital Signal Processing introduces the representation, transformation and manipulation of signals on a computer. DSP is an important and fundamental knowledge for a wide range of application systems, such as consumer electronics, digital communications, digital image applications, medical imaging, and all intelligent application. With the dramatic increase of the processing capability of signal processing microprocessors, it is the expectation that the importance and role of DSP is to accelerate and expand.   Students take this course should be able to understand the most important principles in digital signal processing. Using the MATLAB to practice and understand all theoretical concepts, methods and algorithms.",
