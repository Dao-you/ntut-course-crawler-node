    "schedule": "In addition to supplemental material related to your majors, we will be working through chapters 7–12 of American Headway, which clearly explains a lot of the grammatical intricacies that often trip up non-native speakers.

We will also read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and do an Alice-in-your-major project. Students will also hold simulated company meetings with other students from their major.",
