    "objective": "This course provides an in-depth exploration of mass transfer and its applications in unit operations, drawing heavily from the foundational concepts and methodologies presented in Cussler's Diffusion: Mass Transfer in Fluid Systems. Students will gain a thorough understanding of diffusion, convective mass transfer, and interfacial phenomena, as well as the design and analysis of mass transfer equipment such as distillation columns, absorbers, and membrane systems. Emphasis will be placed on practical problem-solving and the integration of theoretical principles with engineering applications in chemical and biochemical processes.\n\nThis course is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, preparing students for advanced study or professional roles in industries requiring expertise in mass transfer and related operations.",
