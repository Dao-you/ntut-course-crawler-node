    "objective": "中文課程共分四年三階段授課。 第一、二年以華語教學為主，授課重點為：（一）華語基本句型句法；（二）華語基本會話；（三）生活語言；（四）標音系統。第三年 (一學期)，除延續第一、二年華語授課重點外，以段落朗讀和基本認字為主要訓練，並給與中國文字書寫訓練。 第四年 (一學期)，加強會話能力，認字與閱讀能力，並傳授中國文化。\nThe course of Chinese is categorized as three individual stages for four years. In the first year, the course focuses on: (a) Basic Sentence Patterns, (b) Basic Conversation, (c) Languages in the Real Life and (d) the phonetic system for the Chinese language. In the second and the third year (one semester), the training focuses on paragraph reading and term/character recognition-in addition to the teaching themes set in the first year. Writing courses are also added during this stage. In the fourth year (one semester), we add more emphasis on the conversational ability, term/character recognition and reading ability. More culture-related information will be included.",
