    "schedule": "Instructions and procedures are documents that help either developers or end users operate or configure a device or program.\n \nProposals. Most projects begin with a proposal—a document that describes the purpose of a project, the tasks that will be performed in the project, the methods used to complete the project, and finally the cost of the project.\n\nEmails, letters, and memoranda are some of the most frequently written documents in a business.\n \nPress releases. When a company wants to publicly reveal a new product or service, they will have a technical writer author a press release, a document that describes the product's functions and value to the public.\n \nSpecifications are design outlines that describe the structure, parts, packaging, and delivery of an object or process in enough detail that another party can reconstruct it\n. \nDescriptions are shorter explanations of procedures and processes that help readers understand how something works.\n \nRsums and job applications are another example of technical documents. \nTechnical reports are written to provide readers with information, instructions, and analysis on tasks. \n\nCase study is a published report about a person, group, or situation that has been studied over time; also : a situation in real life that can be looked at or studied to learn about something.\n \nWhite papers are documents that are written for experts in a field and typically describe a solution to a technological or business challenge or problem.",
