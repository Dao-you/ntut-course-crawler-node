    "objective": "透過每週的閱讀和課堂討論，本課程將幫助培養學生的英語會話和閱讀技能。  在練習這些技能的過程中，我們將專注於理解西方語言和文化的核心理念，從而理解西方文化中的人（他們的價值觀、動機、原則）的核心理念。   [本課程以往的主題包括：善與惡；體育與社會；美麗；英雄主義]。   透過審視圍繞這一主題的文章和電影，我們將思考這個重要的想法告訴我們關於西方社會及其人民的哪些資訊。\n\nThrough weekly readings and class discussion, this course will help develop students’ English conversation and reading skills.  In the course of practicing such skills, we will focus on an idea central to understanding the language and the culture of the West, and thus an idea central to understanding the people (their values, motivations, principles) of Western culture.   [Past topics for this course include: good and evil; sports and society; beauty; heroism].   Examining essays and films centered around such a topic, we will consider what the significant idea tells us about Western society and its people.",
