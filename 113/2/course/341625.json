    "remarks": "1. This is an EMI course. We hope that our students may reinforce their English ability by participating this course. English ability is definitely helpful for their advanced study.2. Most of our students are graduated from vocational high schools. They had fewer hours in math when comparing with general high school students. We use the standard for general university for our students so that they can catch up with other university syudents.",
