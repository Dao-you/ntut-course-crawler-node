    "objective": "This course covers fundamental concepts and practical methods for electrical circuit analysis. Topics include circuit variables, Kirchhoff’s Laws, and simple resistive circuits. Techniques such as the 2B Method, Nodal Analysis, and Mesh Analysis are introduced and practiced through examples.\n\nKey network theorems, including the Superposition, Thevenin, and Norton Theorems, are discussed for simplifying and analyzing complex circuits. The course concludes with RC, RL, and RLC circuits, focusing on transient and steady-state analysis.",
