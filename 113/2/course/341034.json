    "objective": "本課程將數學應用於生活環境中，根據基礎理論公式，來表示具週期性現象，例如：地球運轉、聲波、馬達等，這種級數的表示稱為傅立葉級數，而非週期性的現象，衍生傅立葉積分與傅立葉轉換。此外，拉普拉斯轉換處理，能夠將機械的或電氣的驅動力有不連續、脈衝的複雜週期性問題簡化，將工程數學導入實際應用。\nMathematics can be applied to the living environment in the course. According to basic theoretical formulas, it represents periodic phenomena, such as: earth movement, sound waves, motors, etc. This series of expressions is called Fourier series. However, Fourier integral and Fourier transform are non-periodic phenomena. In addition, the Laplace transform process can simplify the complicated periodic problems of mechanical or electrical driving forces with discontinuous and impulsive phenomena. The class introduce engineering mathematics into practical applications.",
