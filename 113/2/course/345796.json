    "objective": "This course mainly focuses on explaining the basic concepts and common sense related to polymer materials (for example: the structure of polymers, the formation of structures, molecular motion, etc.), and the molecular structure of polymers will determine its chemical/physical properties. It will determine its use and processing methods. On the application side, the current novel optoelectronic polymers and biomedical polymers will be introduced. It is expected to have a general understanding of polymer materials and their current applications, and to generate interest in polymer materials.",
