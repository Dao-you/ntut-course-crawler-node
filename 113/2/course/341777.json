    "objective": "Our school's general physics courses are specially designed for students with engineering backgrounds. The main purpose is to encourage students to participate in the exploration of the mysteries and laws of the operation of nature, and to provide a solid foundation for subsequent professional courses. The content of this course includes mechanics, thermodynamics, acoustics, electromagnetism, optics and modern physics. The professor can design the course based on three hours per week and two semesters, and then consider the different needs of each department to strengthen or omit certain chapters.",
