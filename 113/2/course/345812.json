    "objective": "The Spacecraft Dynamics and Control course introduces the kinematics, dynamics, and control theory of spacecraft. Students will explore key topics such as spacecraft orbit and kinematics, dynamics, control systems, spacecraft maneuvers, attitude and orbit control, autonomous navigation, and spacecraft rendezvous and docking. The course includes practical hands-on experience with the F Prime (F´) framework for modeling, simulation, and control system implementation. Students will learn to design control systems and solve real-world challenges in spacecraft operations.\n\n太空載具動力學與控制課程旨在探討太空載具的運動學、動力學與控制理論，內容涵蓋太空載具的軌道與運動學、動力學、控制系統設計、太空載具機動、姿態與軌道控制、自主導航，以及太空載具對接技術。本課程特別著重於實務操作，學生將使用 F Prime (F´) 框架進行動態建模、模擬與控制系統的實作，學習如何解決實際太空任務中的控制挑戰，並設計控制系統以實現多樣化的太空載具任務。",
