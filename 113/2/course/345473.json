    "objective": "The reliability analysis technique is a quantitative analysis tool for evaluating the influence of uncertain factors. Engineer reliability is an important index for evaluating engineering design results. Engineering reliability analysis provides necessary information for risk analyses and risk decisions. To facilitate students' understanding of the theoretical background, techniques, and engineering application of reliability analysis, this course reviews and introduces corresponding probability and statistic theories, reliability analysis techniques, limit state design approach, and risk analysis.",

    "remarks": "Due to Covid-19, this course will possibly be given in remote lecturing because of the requirement from the university. If so, the online meeting interface of Google Meet will be adopted and the real-time recording will be uploaded to the Taipei Tech i-Campus website. The class quizzes will be replaced with assignments. The mid-term and the final written examinations will be given in class conventionally. However, this is also adjustable depending on the Covid-19 situation. If necessary, a Line based online group will be setup for flexible discussion activities for students.",
