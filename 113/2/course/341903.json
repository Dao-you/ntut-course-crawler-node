    "objective": "The course is to prepare students for understanding the basic elements of design and the form and principle of art. To achieve these goals, the course provides opportunities for students to apply characteristics and compositions of diverse media for the form of two-dimension and three-dimension in practice. Also, the course arouses student’s design aesthetics and creativity. To explore the context of user-product-environment, students understand visual communication and multimedia language as a basis of interaction design toward completely new experiences and sensation.\n\n本課程旨在瞭解設計的基本要素與美的形式原理，應用各種媒材的特性與構成，從平面及立體的構成的實作練習中，激發出設計美感與創造力。透過「使用者 — 產品 — 環境」三者間互動關係的深入探討，掌握住視覺傳達與多媒體的基本語彙，作為互動設計的基礎，創造出全新的體驗與感受。",
