    "objective": "The ECA courses are designed for the first-year (freshman), non-native English speaking students to strengthen their English language skills, with particular emphasis on communicative competence and practical application in social, cultural and professional contexts. By integrating the four skills (reading, listening, speaking and writing), the primary objective is to connect the classroom ELT with the real-life communicative situations. To that end, the courses adopt the following approaches: communicative language teaching (CLT), task-based learning (TBL), and content-based instruction (CBI), building a holistic pedagogy to English instruction and developing students’ English language proficiency for the next level ESP courses.",
