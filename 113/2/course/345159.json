    "objective": "\"Data-Driven Interdisciplinary Design Research Project\" is an advanced design course that combines academic research and practical experience. This course takes data-driven design as its core, emphasizing the combination of data analysis and design practice, aiming to improve students' cross-field thinking abilities and practical problem-solving abilities. Through close collaboration with graduate students, students will have the opportunity to explore how to apply data-driven strategies to design practice from different perspectives, thereby achieving innovative and practical design solutions. The course will cover multiple modules such as data analysis, user needs research, design verification and experimentation, and emphasize application in the real world. Ultimately, students will complete a design research project with academic value and practical application potential, laying a solid foundation for future professional development or further academic research.\n「數據驅動跨域設計專題研究」是一門結合學術研究與實務經驗的高階設計課程。本課程以數據驅動設計為核心，強調將數據分析與設計實踐相結合，旨在提升學生的跨領域思考能力與解決問題的實踐能力。透過研究生的密切合作，學生將有機會從不同視角出發，探索如何將數據驅動策略應用於設計實務中，進而達成具創新性與實用性的設計解決方案。課程將涵蓋數據分析、使用者需求研究、設計驗證與實驗等多個模組，並強調在真實世界中的應用。最終，學生將完成一個具備學術價值與實際應用潛力的設計專題研究，為未來的專業發展或進一步學術研究打下堅實基礎。",
