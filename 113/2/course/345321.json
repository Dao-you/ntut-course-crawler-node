    "objective": "The breakthrough in Generative AI (GAI) technology has brought about a significant transformation in multimedia content design, with AI-generated videos, images, and text approaching the proficiency level of professionals. This course focuses on two major technologies: Large Language Models (LLM) and Diffusion Models, utilizing open-source tools such as Llama and Stable Diffusion for hands-on practice. In addition to providing an in-depth and comprehensive explanation of the working principles of LLMs and Diffusion Models, the course also teaches students the fundamental operation of AI and how to efficiently produce high-quality and creative AI-generated content. By mastering generative AI technology and its applications, students will be able to embed AI-generated multimedia content into various information systems, significantly enhancing system functionality, aesthetics, and user experience. This course aims to equip students with solid skills in learning, research, and application, achieving a human-AI co-creation of hypermedia content.\n\n* Both theories and applications will be covered.\n* Use Python + Keras for coding in W01~W06.",
