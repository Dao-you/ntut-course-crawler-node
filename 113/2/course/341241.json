    "objective": "The purpose of this course is to understand the fundamental wave theory which describes how light propagates in the form of waves. During the 3-hour weekly practicals, we will be working in small teams on exercises and exploring some simulation tool to help with the material in the lectures. For example, we will introduce a sophisticated tool for studying the propagation of light, transmission of light through a medium, polarization, interference of waves and diffraction.",
    "schedule": "1. The Wave Theory of Light\nMaxwell’s equations. Complex representation. Phase and group velocity. Coherence superposition. Polarization.\n2. Intereference\nWave splitting. Interference fringes. Dielectric films. Multiple-beam interference. Fabry-Perot interferometer .\n3. Diffraction\nKirchhoff’s diffraction formula. Fresnel and Fraunhofer patterns for a single and double slit. Babinet’s principle. Diffraction gratings.\n4. Coherence\nCoherence function and degree of coherence. Stellar interferometry. Imagery. Lasers and holography.",
