Students will be guided to write in response to readings, pictures, events in their daily lives, and discussions from the class.  Thought-provoking topics dealing with current issues are used to stimulate and foster critical writing strategies. This course enables students to write and discuss logically and clearly; they also need to incorporate grammatically newly-built vocabulary into their writing.",
