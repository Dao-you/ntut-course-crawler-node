    "objective": "This semester's Deep Learning (DL) course will focus on Machine Learning (ML), DL, and Generative AI in data science analytics. We will look at supervised, unsupervised and structured learning methods, which will include classic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a shallow or Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), k-Means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This course is designed for graduate students who are interested in AI and its applications in data science analytics. Students who take this course should have mathematical maturity of undergraduate curricula in science and engineering, including Calculus, Discrete Mathematics, Linear Algebra and programming language such as C/C++/MATLAB/Python. Teaching approaches conducted in this course emphasize analysis, modeling and design principles of AI methodology. Case studies, engineering applications of AI in data science analytics, will also be covered in this course. Collaboration Policy: You are free to form study groups and discuss programming assignments and projects. However, you must write up assignments and code independently, and you must acknowledge in your submission all the students you discussed with.",
