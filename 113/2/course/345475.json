    "objective": "The subject is designed to include two professional realms – random vibration and time-frequency domain analysis. The fundamentals of random vibration include statistics, correlation analysis, spectrum estimation, spectral analysis of the SDF system, and so on. The time-frequency domain analysis includes the FFT technique, Hilbert Transform, short-time Fourier Transform, and Wavelet analysis, and so on.",

    "remarks": "Due to Covid-19, this course will possibly be given in remote lecturing because of the requirement from the university. If so, the online meeting interface of Google Meet will be adopted and the real-time recording will be uploaded to the Taipei Tech i-Campus website. The class quizzes will be replaced with assignments. The mid-term and the final written examinations will be given in class conventionally. However, this is also adjustable depending on the Covid-19 situation. If necessary, a Line based online group will be setup for flexible discussion activities for students.",
