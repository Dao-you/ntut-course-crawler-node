    "objective": "光電化學即利用太陽光能源或其他光源驅使一個完整的電化學氧化還原反應，並充分使用光電催化反應後產生的電子轉換為電力，即為太陽能電池，其中有機材料、無機材料與電解質為太陽光電池反應時主要的影響因素。本課程將會介紹光電化學原理與測定，光電催化，光電化學能轉移及儲存，不同材料發展出不同型態的太陽能電池，進而介紹光電化學如何應用於染料敏化太陽能電池。\nThe concept of photoelectrochemistry is to utilize the solar energy and other light sources to drive a complete electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction where the photocatalytic electron reaction has been converted into electrical energy. Photovoltaic cells which also known as solar cells composed of organic and inorganic materials and electrolytes are the great example for the photoelectrochemical reactions. Here the proposed course is constructed to introduce and implement the basic photoelectrochemical principles, measurements, photoelectrocatalysis, photoelectrical charge transfer and the storage of chemical energy. Further the remaining section of this course will be focused on the detailed studies about the development of different inorganic, organic materials for the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells.",
