    "objective": "This course covers the basic concepts, techniques, and technologies involved in parallel computing as well as programming exercises. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the importance of parallel computing in modern scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The course will introduce students to various parallel programming models and tools, including C/C++ programming, multi-processing in Python, OpenMP (in C) for multi-threading, and GPU programming using CUDA and OpenCL. Web-based programming using JavaScript will be included for user interface of some hands-on exercises. No prior programming experience is required.",
