    "objective": "本課程欲提升英文系學生之溝通能力，並著重於簡報部份。中高階英語能力之學生須發表口頭報告，藉此增進有效之語言使用策略。\nThis course aims to enhance English-major students’ communicative competence with special emphasis on business presentations and meetings. By developing effective skills, strategies and tactful language use, students with high-intermediate proficiency level of English will be able to prepare as well as present verbal reports to achieve their career goals.",
    "schedule": "Please note that this is a required skills course for English majors, and we therefore like to keep the class size small so that they can get the attention they need. Non-major students should not choose this class but should instead choose elective English courses. \n\n(This is an old version of the syllabus and may be updated. Please see the new schedule on the first day.) \n\nThe week-by-week schedule will be announced on the first day. Students will be making multiple speeches, as well as reading/viewing effective speeches from history. During the second nine weeks, students will engage in a startup company simulation and will make effective business presentations.\n\nWeek 17 is Dragon Boat Festival. Week 18 you will turn in your final paper.",
