Part 2\nconcentrates on analog circuit and system. Method of biasing a\ndiscrete BJT or EET are given, and stability of the operating point is\ndiscussed. The small-signal model for each device is abstained and used\nto calculate the performance of low frequency single stage and\ncascaded amplifiers.",
