    "objective": "The main goal of this course is to guide students in implementing and experimenting with multisensory feedback technologies from an application and design perspective. Through hands-on exercises and experiments, students will understand the capabilities of different feedback technologies regarding application and design considerations and learn heuristic evaluation, immersive scale, and semi-structured interviews of human-computer interaction systems to analyze and understand the performance of human-computer interaction systems (programming language: C++). In addition, this course will take the form of group exercises in the innovative ability to strengthen students' cross-field proposals through cooperative learning and prototyping skills.\n\n本課程主要的目標為從應用與設計的角度，帶領同學進行多感官回饋技術的實作及實驗。從實作及實驗中學生將了解不同回饋技術在應用面上的可能性及其設計考量，並學習人機互動系統的啟發式評估、沉浸式量表、半結構式訪談，從而剖析及理解人機互動系統的表現 (程式語言：C++)。此外本課程將以小組實習方式來進行，期望藉由合作學習和雛型製作來強化學生跨領域提案之創新能力。",
