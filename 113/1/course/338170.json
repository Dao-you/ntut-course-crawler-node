    "objective": "This course introduces the basic principles of the finite element method and its applications in various engineering problems. Topics include fundamental concepts of finite element analysis, establishing finite element models using variational principles, shape functions, and iso-parametric elements. It covers one-dimensional problems such as rods, trusses, beams, and frames; two-dimensional problems including plane stress, plane strain, and plate-shell problems; and three-dimensional problems involving general solids. Practical exercises and case studies using finite element analysis software are included for practice and research analysis.\nThis semester, the course integrates USR (University Social Responsibility) into the curriculum, guiding students to apply finite element analysis to the USR project. Students who heavily participate in the USR project can utilize finite analysis in their USR electrical vehicle designs and/or for systematic improvements.",

All homework should be submitted through the e-learning. No late homework will not be accepted except having approved absence. The project report is due the day of the oral presentation. 5 points would be subtracted per each single day delay. Delaying for 5 days or more would get no point.\n7.\tCopy and cheating are not allowed. If one is found copy and cheating, 0 point would be given for the event.\n8.\tPlease set your phone in silent or vibration mode while in class, otherwise 5 points will be deducted from the semester score and treated as one absence for each violation.\n9.\tAttendance check will be done every week.
