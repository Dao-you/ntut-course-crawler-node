    "objective": "This course introduces the basic principles of the finite element method and its applications in various engineering problems. Topics include fundamental concepts of finite element analysis, establishing finite element models using variational principles, shape functions, and iso-parametric elements. It covers one-dimensional problems such as rods, trusses, beams, and frames; two-dimensional problems including plane stress, plane strain, and plate-shell problems; and three-dimensional problems involving general solids. Practical exercises and case studies using finite element analysis software are included for practice and research analysis.\n  This semester, the course integrates USR (University Social Responsibility) into the curriculum, guiding students to apply finite element analysis to the USR project. Students who heavily participate in the USR project can utilize finite analysis in their USR electrical vehicle designs and/or for systematic improvements.",
