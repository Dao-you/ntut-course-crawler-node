    "objective": "This course introduces various translation practices in the digital age and familiarizes students with appropriate translation methods and strategies. In the first part of the course, students will gain an understanding of online collaborative translation, translation crowdsourcing, fansubbing, and video game translation. In the second part, students will participate in two authentic online translation projects: Global Voices Lingua and Wikipedia translation. For the former, students will collaborate with the Lingua project's Chinese editors to produce Chinese translations of citizen news posts for publication on Global Voices. For the latter, students will engage in Wikipedia translation in various forms to develop their individual and social metacognition related to translation and enhance their ability to handle the translation of various text types. Students’ active engagement in project-based tasks is critical to this course. This involvement provides them with fundamental skills and keeps them current on newly-emerged translation practices.",
