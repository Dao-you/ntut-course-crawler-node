    "objective": "This course is to explore the fields of interaction design, interactive media and interactive art and focus on the literature study, paper discussion and case studies. With panel discussion, research report and design practice, graduate students can be able to learn the ability of research, analysis and practice by effectively exchange opinions and personal experience. The aim of interaction design is to integrate different disciplines from computer science, mechatronics, human-culture and design and art so as to foster the profession of interaction design. Therefore, one of the aims of this course is to construct multi-disciplines learning environment which performs a topic-oriented study model. This study model formulates the graduate students of design, art, information and mechatronic disciplines to collaborate on an interactive media design project. It may execute interaction design by working with the form of the case study or design creation.",
