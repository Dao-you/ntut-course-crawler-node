    "objective": "本課程旨在深入介紹統計技術和最佳化概念，藉以輔助管理之決策。課程涵蓋統計學及最佳化相關主題，包括描述性統計、相關分析、抽樣和估計、概率分布、假設檢驗、回歸模型、實驗設計和線性規劃。通過課程學生還將獲得統計和最佳化軟件（如 LINGO 和 Excel）的實際操作經驗。修習課程之學生將具備應用統計和最佳化工具處理實務問題之技能和知識，使其能夠基於數量方法之做出決策及管理。\nThis course aims to offer an in-depth understanding of statistical techniques and optimization concepts for making informed management decisions. The course provides a comprehensive overview of key topics in statistics, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, sampling and estimation, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, regression models, design of experiments, and linear programming. Students will also gain practical experience in statistical and optimization software such as LINGO and Excel through interactive tutorials. On completion of this course, students would be able to equip with the skills and knowledge needed to apply statistical and optimization tools to real-life situations, allowing them to make informed decisions based on quantitative methods.",
