    "objective": "Electrochemical analysis can provide more advanced information, including biochemical reactions, morphology, as well as properties related to physics, chemistry, and electricity. Utilizing relevant technical methods, such as electrochemical tools, can be used to study heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions, as well as to obtain chemical activity and spectra among various interfaces for the development of microdevices. For biological analysis, electrochemical biosensors exhibit the highest reproducibility and can be successfully applied to electroactive biochemical species, matrix materials, and their specifications. Bioelectroanalytical methods include the most advanced and useful techniques, most of which are built on the foundation of this field.",
