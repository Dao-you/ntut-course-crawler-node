    "objective": "本課程主旨在介紹計算生物學及醫學資訊學相關之重要主題，目的在於提供學生漸進式的介紹，理解當代最新之各項生醫分析技術。本課程主要為有志於跨領域學習之學生所設計，內容包含基礎生物學的核心知識與基礎 Linux 操作，以及生醫領域的經典演算法、常用資料庫與工具的介紹，奠定基礎後開始進入次世代分析技術的應用，主題將包含 DNA 定序、RNA 定序與總體基因體學分析。希望透過這些內容讓學生在分析各種基因資料之前，先了解這些分子在細胞和個體中的重要性。接著，透過研究實例和分析操作，讓學生接觸到實際實驗測量產生的數據，體會真實研究的過程。藉由實際操作相關分析工具，使學生體會基因數據在實務上的重要性，達到將生物理論與實務應用緊密結合的目標。\nThis course aims to introduce important topics related to computational biology and medical informatics. The objective is to provide students with a gradual introduction to understanding the latest contemporary biomedical analysis techniques. This course is primarily designed for students interested in interdisciplinary learning. The content includes concept knowledge of basic biology, fundamental Linux operations, classic algorithms in the biomedical field, and introductions to commonly used databases and tools. After establishing this foundation, the course will progress to the application of next-generation sequencing technology, covering topics such as DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and metagenomics analysis. The goal is to help students understand the importance of these molecules in cells and organisms before analyzing various genetic data. Subsequently, through research case studies and analytical operations, students will engage with data generated from actual experimental measurements, experiencing the real research process. Through the actual application of relevant analytical tools, students will have a comprehensive understanding of the process of interpreting genetic data. This will enable them to integrate biological theory with real-world scenarios effectively.",
