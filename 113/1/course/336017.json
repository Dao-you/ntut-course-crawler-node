    "objective": "The goal of this course is to survey the major theoretical perspectives in organizational theory (OT). More specifically, we introduce the foundation questions of the strategy field and focus on the strategy ‘content” research in this class. The major purpose of this class is to expose students to samples of contemporary strategy content research and to point out some access points to the broader universe of thought on each topic. In other words, we will start from the fundamentals in order to have a solid understanding of the theoretical approach. This elaboration will be followed by a more in-depth exploration of the empirical articles assigned for each week, and how this contributes to organization theory. Finally, we will move on to the assessment and critique of the theoretical view. One or two students will be assigned to lead each week’s discussion.",
