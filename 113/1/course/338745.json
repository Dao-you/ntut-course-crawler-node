    "objective": "This course will focuse on the application of principles of linear modeling in the context of linear regression analysis to exploring questions about mediated (i.e., indirect) and moderated (i.e., interaction) effects. We will spend part of the course talking about partitioning effects into direct and indirect components and how to quantify and test hypotheses about indirect effects, part talking about estimating, testing, and probing interactions in linear models, and part integrating moderation and mediation as “conditional process analysis” by discussing and how to conceptualize and test the contingencies of a mechanism. Computer applications will focus on R using off-the-shelf code and the PROCESS macro available through www.processmacro.org and documented in the text for the course. It is assumed that you have taken a course in multiple regression and have done well or are otherwise comfortable with the principles of multiple regression analysis. No knowledge of matrix algebra is required or assumed.",
