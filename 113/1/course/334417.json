    "objective": "The course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to Internet and computer networking technologies. Unlike traditional course, it pursues a top-down approach to the topics, starting with the application layer and then describing the transport and network layers, finally covering the physical layer. The topics covered in course are: (1) Network Application, (2) TCP and UDP protocols, (3) Network Layer - Data Plane, (4) Network Layer - Control Plane, (5) Link Layer & Local Area Networks, (6) Wireless and Mobile Network, and (7) Multimedia Networking.",
