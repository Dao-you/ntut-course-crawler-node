    "objective": "Course Introduction\nDiscrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics devoted to the study of discrete objects (i.e., objects that are distinct and unconnected). This course will introduce and apply various discrete structures and techniques to solve real-world problems.\nMain Topics\n1.\tCryptography and Network Security\no\tDesigning effective passwords\no\tApplications of encryption techniques\no\tAnti-spam technologies\n2.\tProbability and Statistics\no\tCalculating the probability of winning a lottery\no\tAnalyzing random processes in networks\n3.\tGraph Theory and Networks\no\tCalculating the connections between computers\no\tDesigning efficient transportation routes\n4.\tSorting and Algorithm Design\no\tProving the correctness of sorting algorithms\no\tCalculating the number of steps required for sorting\n5.\tComputational Theory and Logic\no\tDesigning circuits that add integers\no\tCalculating the number of valid Internet addresses\nLearning Objectives\n•\tDevelopment of Mathematical Thinking and Logical Reasoning: Cultivate the ability to understand and create mathematical arguments, laying the foundation for advanced mathematical studies.\n•\tFoundations in Computer Science: Provide the necessary mathematical background for advanced courses in computer science, such as data structures, algorithms, compiler theory, and more.\n•\tOperations Research and Applications: Equip students with the mathematical background required to solve problems in operations research, chemical engineering, biology, and related fields.\nCourse Features\n•\tEmphasis on Problem-Solving: The course focuses on teaching mathematical reasoning and problem-solving rather than merely imparting skills.\n•\tFostering Creativity and Critical Thinking: Through diverse topics and problems, students are encouraged to apply their knowledge to new challenges.\n•\tPractice in Mathematical Proofs: Students will learn how to read, write, and validate mathematical proofs, which will be valuable for advanced courses.\n\nThis course aims to equip students with the necessary tools and skills to tackle challenges in future courses and professional work.",
