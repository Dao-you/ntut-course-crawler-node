    "objective": "建立學生對各類資料探勘技術與理論的基礎觀念及架構，以奠定學生日後從事資料探勘分析與研究工作時之需。相關的分析技術將包括應用在分類 (classification)、推估 (estimation)、預測 (prediction)、關聯式分組 (affinity grouping)、同質分組 (clustering) 等功能中的決策樹、(decision tree) 多變量分析 (multivariate analysis) 及類神經網路 (neural network) 等方法。此外為了讓學生對相關技術有更深的瞭解，課程中將以個案實例為主，並配合各種資料探勘套裝軟體，以應用的觀點使學生更容易接受了解在商業智慧分析上資料探勘分析的功用。\nSeveral fundamental theories of data mining techniques are included in this course. For examples, decision tree, multivariate analysis and neural network. All these techniques will be applied in different areas, such as classification, association rule, forecasting, and pattern recognition. And various applications in different enterprises are also included.",
