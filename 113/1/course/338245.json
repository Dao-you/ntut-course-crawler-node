    "objective": "此課程主要是含蓋無線通訊基頻訊號處理的理論基礎與系統架構，探討無線通道所能提供的通道容量以及可靠通訊。而大部分的課程內容會以目前熱門的多輸入多輸出 (MIMO) 傳輸為背景而進行探討。\n\nThis course provides the fundamental theories and architectures for baseband wireless communications. It is concerned that how reliable communication can be achieved and what is the capacity a channel can provide. Much attention will be focused on the newly developed technology, referred to as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission.",
