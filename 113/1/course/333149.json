    "objective": "本課程以化工程序中所包含的製程如蒸餾、熱交換器、攪拌、泵、機械分離等，由質量、能量及動量均衡開始講述，然後探討程序設計時使用的流程圖及其符號、成本估算、管線配置、流體輸送、化工單元規格設計等。\nApplication of chemical engineering science techniques to design of chemical processes. Comprehensive problems are assigned which include heat, material and economic balances, unit operations and processes, kinetics and thermodynamics.\nThe major responsibility is placed on individuals or small groups for the optimum design and selection of equipment, and for the calculations of required sizes, plant layout, and cost analyses.",
