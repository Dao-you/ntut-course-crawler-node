    "objective": "Gamification is a technique that can stimulate users’ motivation and engagement in various non-game contexts such as education, business, health, workplace, and so on. This course is divided into two parts. The first part provides the theoretical background, consisting of the gamification definition/taxonomy, and behavioral design. In the second part of this course, students will organize a participatory design workshop to gain insights from the stakeholders to develop a gamified product, service, or system that are fun, engaging, and rewarding.",
