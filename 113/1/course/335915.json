    "objective": "The scholarship of “Medium and Environment” was first explored by Marshall McLuhan in the 1960s with a series of academic and practical works. However, this field was not gaining much attention until the past decade when technology has brought novel challenges. Scholars in both urban studies and media studies have been shifting their focuses to this aspect. Because of this, the studies of medium and environment has recently been an emerging field that intends to examine the phenomena intertwining the two aspects through interdisciplinary approach. Based on this background, this course will introduce cutting-edge scholarships of medium and environment studies to the traditional field of urban cultural studies, pursuing effective perspectives to unfold today’s critical urban issues, for instance globalization in digital era, the popularity of carnival and creative industries, smart and resilient city, Netflix economy/urbanism (Harvey, 2020), and so forth. Student will be expected to learn how to bridge theories and practices, to develop ability of critical thinking, and to learn corresponding methodologies.",
