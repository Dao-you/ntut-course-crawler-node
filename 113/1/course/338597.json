    "objective": "使用 Unity 3D 建立專業的  VR/AR/XR   應用程序，Unity 3D 是一款功能強大的跨平台 3D 引擎，可提供用戶友好的開發環境。 在本課程中，學生將學習如何從頭開始建立 VR 引擎，以便學生充分了解從 3D 模型到 VR 顯示器中的像素的整個 3 D 圖形顯現管道。 學生還將學習如何在 Unity 中實現最重要的 VR 互動概念，例如選擇、操作、旅行、尋路、選單和文字輸入。\n\n學生在本課程中學到的  VR/AR/XR   程式設計知識將有助於學生編寫  VR/AR/XR   遊戲、建築演練、工程模擬、3D 數據檢視器、醫療培訓應用程式等。學生還將了解利用人工智慧增強虛擬實境的方法。在 VR 應用中，可以將培訓材料擬人化為互動式角色。當與自然語言處理、情感分析、路徑查找等人工智慧應用相結合時，很容易看出沉浸式技術如何徹底改變訓練。\n\nBuild professional VR/AR/XR apps using Unity 3D, a powerful cross-platform 3D engine that provides a user-friendly development environment. In this course, students will learn how to build a VR engine from the ground up, so students fully understand the entire rendering pipeline from 3D model to pixels in the VR display. Students will also learn how to implement the most important VR interaction concepts such as selection, manipulation, travel, wayfinding, menus, and text input in Unity.\n\nWhat students learn about  VR/AR/XR   programming in this course will help students write  VR/AR/XR   games, architectural walkthroughs, engineering simulations, 3D data viewers, medical training applications, and many more. Students will also learn about ways to enhance virtual reality with AI. In VR applications, it is possible to personify training material as an interactive character. When coupled with AI applications, such as natural language processing, sentiment analysis, path finding and others, it’s easy to see how immersive technology could revolutionize training.",
