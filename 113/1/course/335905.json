    "objective": "Since the mid-twentieth century, there is evidence of a substantial shift in the center of debates within architecture and its relationship with other academic disciplines, particularly cultural studies and philosophy. It, however, was a reciprocal process. Not only are architects and architectural theorists becoming close to ideas of cultural theory, but significant numbers of cultural theorists, philosophers and sociologists are to be found highly engaged with questions of architecture and the built environment. However, it has been recently found that architects and students of architecture may struggle to deeply navigate those thinkers' work, resulting in unexpected distances and hazes between disciplines. Therefore, there are two intentions for forming this module. Firstly, it attempts to introduce architecture to a broader cultural context and to consider how debates from cultural theory might begin to inform a discussion about architecture (Leach 1997). Secondly, it tries to locate architectural thinking in the body of significant work of cultural studies, which helps decode terms and provide a clear pathway to critical thinkers (Sharr 2007). This module is structured by some selected cultural figures whose writings have profoundly impacted architectural designers and critics in distinctive ways. Followingly, the very question of what architecture's definition will be reconsidered with more vibrant and plentiful contents.",
