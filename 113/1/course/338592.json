    "objective": "User experience designers are designers who particularly require horizontal and vertical skills. This course allows students to understand the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools of user experience designers from four different aspects: objects, processes, experiences, and narratives. Students will learn to combine qualitative and quantitative methods and tools of user research to shape the information architecture of physical and digital products or services. In addition, students will master how to use briefings and visual communication to promote design decisions within the organization and learn to prototype design planning and implement usability testing using physical and remote tools. The course will also introduce how to use generative AI to assist UX research and design. On the other hand, this course also profoundly explores the trends of UX in academic research, integrating both academic and practical aspects.\nUX（User Experience）使用者經驗設計師，是一種特別需要橫向與縱向技能的設計師。本課程從物件 (objects) 、流程 (processes)、體驗 (experiences)、敘事 (narratives) 四個不同的脈絡切面，讓學生了解使用者經驗設計師的必備知識、技能與工具。學生將學會結合使用者研究的質性和量化方法及其工具來塑造實體與數位產品或服務的資訊架構。另一方面，本課程也深入探討 UX 於學術研究上的趨勢，讓學術與實務層面兼備。\n此外，學生將掌握如何利用簡報和視覺化溝通來促進組織內的設計決策，並學習 Prototype 設計規劃與實施易用性測試，使用實體與遠端工具。課程中也將介紹如何運用生成式 AI 輔助 UX 研究與設計。",
