    "objective": "The \"User Experience Research and Practice\" course is designed to equip master's students with comprehensive UX design knowledge and practical skills. By utilizing an open-access online textbook, the course covers a broad spectrum of topics, from the fundamentals of interaction design to cutting-edge subjects. Through reading, reflection, and class presentations, students will explore key areas of UX design, including human-computer interaction, visual design, affective computing, and usability evaluation. The course emphasizes the integration of theory and practice, encouraging students to apply concepts from the textbook to real-world design challenges.\n\nA distinctive feature of the course is integrating interdisciplinary knowledge from fields such as neuroscience, anthropology, and philosophy into UX design. Students will learn to apply theoretical frameworks like phenomenology and semiotics to deepen their understanding of user experience and translate these insights into innovative design solutions. The course also covers emerging areas like social computing and open-user innovation, providing students with a broader perspective on the societal implications and opportunities within UX design. Ultimately, this course aims to develop UX professionals with critical thinking, innovative spirit, and interdisciplinary perspectives, ready to create products and services that meet user needs and drive technological and societal progress.\n\nStudents will learn…\n1. Master core UX design theories and apply interdisciplinary knowledge to solve complex design problems.\n2. Utilize various UX research methods, such as contextual design and user story mapping.\n3. Integrate theories from neuroscience and phenomenology to deepen the understanding of user experience and design.\n4. Learn techniques to evaluate and measure user experience, optimizing design solutions and decision-making processes.\n5. Explore emerging UX fields like social computing and open innovation to expand design perspectives.\n6. Cultivate critical thinking by integrating UX design into broader social and technological contexts.",
