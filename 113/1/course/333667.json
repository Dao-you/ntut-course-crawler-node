    "objective": "本課程旨在以專題設計方式，訓練學生確認並建立需求、發展設計選擇方案、製作設計的互動形式、設計評估的專業知能，並以設計專案方式演練完整之設計過程。學生經由分組合作或獨自創作完成一設計主題。上學期課程以題目釐定、資料蒐集、分析調查、設計定義、構想發展、程式設計、雛型製作等活動為教學內容；下學期則進行觀察測試、使用性評估、程式調校、專刊編輯、展示佈置以及設計報告提交等為教學內容，以培養學生具備互動設計專題製作之專業知能。\nThrough project design, the course prepares students to confirm the needs of design, develop alternatives of design projects, create interactive modes, and evaluate design performance through independent study or cooperative learning. In the first semester, learning materials of the course include subject clarification, data collection, analysis and investigation, design definition, concept development, programming, and prototyping. In the second semester, learning materials of the course include observation and testing, usability evaluation, programming debug, report editing, exhibition and design report submission. Accordingly, students will be ready for professional competencies of interaction design projects.",
