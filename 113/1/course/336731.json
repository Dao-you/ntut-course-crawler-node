    "objective": "The aim of this course is to help students to acquire the basic knowledge of  electronics, especially in application perspective. The preliminary knowledge of this course is basic circuit theory. After that, the basic components, which are about diode, rectifier, BJT, OP Amp., MOSFET, JFET, FET Amp.,will be taught in this course. Finally, we will ask students for conceiving a new reports related to the application in electronics.",
