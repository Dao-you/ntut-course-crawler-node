    "objective": "本課程介紹研究方法和論文寫作知識，期能培養學生獨立研究和撰寫學術報告、論文的基本能力。主要分為三部份：（一）研究內涵與步驟，（二）主要的研究方法，（三）如何撰寫英文論文及報告。涵蓋主題包括：運用圖書館資源選擇研究主題、研究計劃的撰寫、問卷調查法、訪問法、觀察法、田野工作研究方法、文獻資料分析法（內容分析法）、個案研究法、相關研究法、實驗法、文學研究法，研究報告論文格式與寫作要領，如何撰寫文獻探討，參考書目寫法等。\nThis course is primarily designed for students interested in working on a senior project in literature, film, popular culture, or cultural studies, but most of the material can be generally applied, so students who are uncertain whether their final project will be in literature/cultural studies or linguistics can benefit from the course. It aims at providing students with the fundamental knowledge and competence that they will need in doing research and writing research papers. The main topics for instruction include the research process, major research methods, approaches to literary and cultural studies criticism, and the structure of a research paper. Students will learn how to come up with a high-quality research question, best practices for evaluating source material, how to make use of the electronic and hard-copy sources that are available (including subscription and open-access sources), AI uses and pitfalls, and how to carry out a long-term research project, with the goal of avoiding the pitfalls that first-time research project students and writers may fall into. Students will also learn the circumstances under which MLA style is the best style to use, to use it correctly, and to distinguish it from APA style. This course is designed for English majors: while students from other disciplines may sign up, they must be prepared to do assignments designed for English majors preparing for their senior projects and to meet the same expectations.",
