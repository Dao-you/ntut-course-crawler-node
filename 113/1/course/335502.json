    "remarks": "1. I will put the class material (power points) and  make announcement on  \"i-school Plus\". 2. If online learning is required,  we will use Microsoft Teams. Moreover, I will record all classes on both Microsoft Teams and \"i-school Plus\" no matter we have physical classes or not.3. If online learning is required, submit your homeworks using \"i-school Plus\".4. If we are using on-line learning at exams, we will use Microsoft Teams and  \"i-school Plus\" and you have to upload your exam paper using  \"i-school Plus\".",
