Students uncomfortable with English-only instruction are advised not to enroll in this course. Thank you!\n\nThis course content is about 3D creation and space design software through theoretical and practical cases: 3DS MAX - the concept and application scope, and then the teacher introduces the methods of 3D environment construction into practical case practice operations, and finally creates students' own creation project. The purpose of the course is to train students to use the 3DS MAX software to construct 3D models, character modeling, space, and related objects, and use the result and performance to space display.",
