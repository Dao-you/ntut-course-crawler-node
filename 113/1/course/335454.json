The theory and practice of employing SAR focusing algorithms on the basis of the signal models are highlights of this course. In order to link the real synthetic aperture radar signal scenarios, the real SAR echo signal data will also be used in this course, in addition to introducing the basic imaging geometry. The image quality after imaging with different focusing algorithms will be compared, and the differences between the focusing algorithms will also be discussed. After the course, students can understand the characteristics of SAR images, including the principle of SAR signals, signal model, data acquisition modes, focusing algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages.",
