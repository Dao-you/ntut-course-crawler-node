    "objective": "Bioenergy is referred to the energy stored in living or recently living biological organisms, such as animals, plants and microbes. The source of bioenergy can be traced back from plants harvesting the sunlight and converting it to glucose, then to other biopolymers such as polysaccharides. The technologies for developing bioenergy, with an emphasis on environmentally compatible, consist of gene cloning technology from molecular biology and enzymatic control and catalytic chemistry (i.e. green chemistry).  The course is an introduction course on the types of polysaccharides in animals and plants, how scientist use system biology to develop bioengergy.",
