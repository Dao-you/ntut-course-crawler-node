    "objective": "本課程探討結構元件以及結構系統之穩定問題，諸如柱、梁柱、圓環、剛架及平板等。同時，非線性挫曲後行為亦予介紹。\nThis course discusses the stability problems of structural members as well as structural systems such as columns, beam-columns, frames, rings, and plates. In the mean times, the nonlinear post buckling behaviors are also introduced.",
