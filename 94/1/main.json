geology is a branch of earth science. It has developed rapidly over the past decade. The reason for the recent advances in structural geology has been the realization that naturally deformed rocks seen in field outcrops contain a fantastic range of small-scale features which relate directly to large-scale orogenic deformation systems. The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course.

The task of decision making entails choosing between various alternatives. This choice is governed by our desire to make the \"best\" decision. The measure of goodness of the alternatives is described by an objective function or performance index. Optimization theory and methods deal with selecting the best alternative in the sense of the given objective function. The purpose of this course is to provide a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods. To accomplish this goal, we include many examples that illustrate the theory and algorithms discussed in the class. However, it is not my intention to provide a cookbook of the most recent numerical techniques for optimization; rather, my goal is to equip the students with sufficient background for further study of advanced topics in optimization."},"id":"85909","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=94&sem=1&code=863","code":"863"}],"teacher":[{"name":"蘇順豐","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=11152","code":"11152"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["5","6","7"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"綜科216","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=196","code":"196"}],"people":"29","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105092","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"4005003","name":{"zh":"工程分析","en":"Engineering Analysis"},"description":{"zh":"偏微分方程式、變分法、張量分析、工程統計及積分方程式等工程分析用工具知識。","en":"Partial Differential equation, Variation Principle, Tensor Analysis, Engineering Statistics and Integral equation."},"id":"85918","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"機電所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=94&sem=1&code=866","code":"866"},{"name":"製科所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=94&sem=1&code=875","code":"875"}],"teacher":[{"name":"王金樹","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=10624","code":"10624"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["5","6","7"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"22","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"綜科館110-1","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=4005003","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=85918&code=10624"]},{"code":"4005004","name":{"zh":"機械系統","en":"Mechanical Systems"},"description":{"zh":"機構、機械設計、古典動力學、熱力學第一定律及熱平衡、潤滑與摩擦、機械加工、機電系統匹配、機械負載等及實驗(作)。","en":"Mechanism and Mechanical design, Classical Dynamics, Thermal Analysis, lubrication and wear, Mechatronic system design and practice."},"id":"85919","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"4","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"機電所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=94&sem=1&code=866","code":"866"}],"teacher":[{"name":"洪永銘","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=10445","code":"10445"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["1","2","3","4"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教302(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=45","code":"45"}],"people":"26","peopleWithdraw":"1","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=4005004","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"4005040","name":{"zh":"近代光學","en":"Modern Optics"},"description":{"zh":"先修課程：光學。一、幾何光學：光學基本定律、球面光學系統成像、雷射光傳播特性、光纖、輻射度學與光度學。二、物理光學：光的電磁理論、光波的疊加與分析、光的干涉與干涉儀、光學鍍膜、光的繞射、光的偏振、晶體光學基礎。","en":"A、 Geometrical optics 1.Basic optical laws 2.Paraxial systems 3.Laser beams 4.Optical fiber 5.PhotometryB、 Physical optics 1.EM waves of light 2.Superposition of light waves 3.Interference and interferometer 4.Optical coating and thin film 5.Diffraction 6.Polarization 7.Light in crystal"},"id":"85932","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"機電所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=94&sem=1&code=866","code":"866"}],"teacher":[{"name":"蘇春𤂌","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=11129","code":"11129"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["1","2","5"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教207(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=41","code":"41"}],"people":"4","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=4005040","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"4006001","name":{"zh":"微機電技術與應用","en":"MEMS Technology and Applications"},"description":{"zh":"微加工程序含MUMPS，打樣、沉積、蝕刻；設計工具含MEMCAD, Matlab, EM software, and Ansys 等；應用例含壓力感測器、加速度計、探針卡、微波元件、生物晶片等；最後介紹封裝與測試技術。","en":"1.
