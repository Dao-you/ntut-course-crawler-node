In this course, we will discuss how to apply the computer to assist the molecular structure design. In order to gain insight into the basic concepts of structural design, the fundamental background of chemical bonding will be introduced at the beginning of this course. Then, the geometry of designed molecules will be optimized based on the theory of molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and quantum mechanics. We will emphasize the real practical to get the optimized structures of those designed molecules.\n\nOutline: \n1.　　Introduction\n2.　　Introduction to chemical bonding of molecules and solids \n3.　　Introduction to Molecular Mechanics\n4.　　Properties Analysis\n5.　　Optimization Techniques\n6.　　Molecular Dynamics","schedule":"Week 1.　　Introduction to computational chemistry\nWeek 2.　　Review fundamental chemical bonding theory (I)\nWeek 3.　　Review fundamental chemical bonding theory (II)\nWeek 4.　　Force Field Methods (I)\nWeek 5.　　Force Field Methods (I)\nWeek 6.　　Electronic Structure Methods (I) \nWeek 7.　　Electronic Structure Methods (II)\nWeek 8.　　Electronic Structure Methods (III)\nWeek 9.　　Density Functional Methods (I)\nWeek 10.　　Density Functional Methods (II)\nWeek 11.　　Density Functional Methods (III)\nWeek 14.　　Illustrating the Concepts (I)\nWeek 15.　　Illustration the Concepts (II)\nWeek 16.　　Optimization Techniques \nWeek 17.　　Simulation Techniques (I)\nWeek 18.　　Simulation Techniques (II)","scorePolicy":"(1) 期中: 30%\n(2) 期末: 30%\n(3) 平時: 40%","materials":"1.　　Frank Jensen, Introduction to Computational Chemistry, 2nd, 2007, John Wiley and Sons.\n2.　　Tim Clark, A Handbook of Computational Chemistry, 1985, John Wiley and Sons.\n3.　　Ira N.
