An exploration will be made into their possible implications for translation practice and the translator's qualifications. Translation issues to be addressed may include the following: globalization/localization and translation, technology and translation, transcreation (creative translation), advertisement/marketing and translation, video game translation, website translation, tourism translation, quality control, community/crowdsourcing translation and fansubbing. Through concrete examples of authentic translations, this course will enable students to better understand how the new trends in translation studies can guide translation practice, and lead students to rethink the translators professional qualifications. Also included in the course are practical English'/Chinese translation exercises and translation commentaries, which can assist students in keeping abreast with the new trends and formulating appropriate translation strategies.","schedule":"Week 1: introduction\nWeek 2: globalization/localization and translation \nWeek 3: crowdsourcing and collaborative translation (1) \nWeek 4: crowdsourcing and collaborative translation (2)\nWeek 5: fansubbing (1)\nWeek 6: fansubbing (2)\nWeek 7: fansubbing and language learning\nWeek 8: transcreation (creative translation) (1)\nWeek 9: transcreation (creative translation) (2) \nWeek 10: website translation (1)\nWeek 11: website translation (2)\nWeek 12: video game translation (1)\nWeek 13: video game translation (2)\nWeek 14: tourism translation (1)\nWeek 15: tourism translation (2)\nWeek 16: comic translation\nWeek 17: research proposal presentations\nWeek 18: group translation project","scorePolicy":"1. attendance and participation: 20%\n2. oral presentations and reading reflections: 30%\n3. one translation/commentary task and one group translation project: 25%\n4. the research proposal (including the oral presentation): 25%","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
