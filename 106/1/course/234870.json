The focus of our study will be upon those situations in which two or more cultures interact with one another—linguistically, artistically, politically, militarily and/or spiritually.  We will study texts and films underscoring the problematics of cross-cultural interactions as have emerged from colonial and post-colonial social structures.  Our course materials will particularly focus on aboriginal, Caribbean, African-American and Latino cultures, but you will have a chance to make cross-cultural comparisons of other cultures in which you may have a particular interest in papers and oral presentations.","scorePolicy":"GRADING\n\n25%　　Midterm Paper 　　　　　　25%　　Presentation\n25%　　Final Paper　　　　　　25%　　Participation &amp; Journals","materials":"TEXTS\n\nCourse Reader (Containing articles by Julio Finn, Frank Kofsky and Paul Garon; “The Blackamoor of Peter the Great” by Alexander Pushkin; selected American folk ballads; poetry by Bob Kaufman, Amiri Baraka and Ntzake Shange; and song lyrics by Jimmy Cliff.)\n\nBlake Elk Speaks: Being the Life of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux as told through John G.
