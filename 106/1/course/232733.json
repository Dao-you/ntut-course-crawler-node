Examples of genres are:  romance, comedy, tragedy, horror, fantasy; stories about war, about travel, or about sports.  Unlike traditional literary fields, genre study is not limited to one particular period in time (like the 19th century) or to one particular author (like Shakespeare).  Studying a genre helps us to think about the relationship between similar texts from many different time periods and many different cultures.  This course will help students develop close reading and analytical skills, as well as deepen their understanding of essential ideas in Western culture by focusing on stories belonging to a culturally significant genre.","schedule":"　","scorePolicy":"Grades:\n-Midterm 50%\n-Final 50%\n\nAttendance: a combination of 4 absences or late days = -10 points from course grade","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
