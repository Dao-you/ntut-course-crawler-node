Linear Equations \n　　To understand the basic terminologies and notations of matrices and systems of linear equations, in the forms of vector equation and matrix equation.\n　　Solving a system of linear equations with the Gaussian elimination: reducing a matrix to its echelon form. \n　　To interpret a system of linear equations in various ways.\n　　First exposure to key concepts such as linear independence and linear transformation. \n2. Matrix Algebra \n　　To learn basic matrix arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication power, transpose, and inverse.\n　　To summarize the concepts for systems of n linear equations in n unknowns. \n3. Vector Spaces \n　　Introduction to vector spaces. \n　　Fundamental subspaces of a matrix: column space, row space, and null space.\n　　Basis and dimension of a vector space. \n4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n　　To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. \n　　Diagonalization of a matrix (linear transformation).\n5. Orthogonality and Orthogonal Bases \n　　To introduce inner product of vectors, and thus the geometric concepts of length, distance, and angle (perpendicularity).\n　　To be familiar with the use of orthogonal bases.\n　　Least-Squares approximation.","scorePolicy":"1.
