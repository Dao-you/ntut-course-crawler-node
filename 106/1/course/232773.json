The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model. The physical object can be measured using 3D scanning technologies like CMMs, laser scanners, structured light digitizers, or Industrial CT Scanning (computed tomography). The measured data alone, usually represented as a point cloud, lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of NURBS surfaces, or a CAD model.","schedule":"1 　　Surface Digitization\n2,3 　　Digitizing Devices, Tactile Probes\n4,5,6 　　Non-Contact Probes\n7,8 　　Surface Representation, Least Squares Surface Approximation Techniques\n9　　Mid-Term exam\n10 　　Curve Fitting Algorithm, Surface Fitting\n11,12 　　Apply RE software to construct CAD model from point cloud\n13 　　Computer Aided Design\n14 　　Computer Aided Engineering, \n15-18 　　Programming demonstration","scorePolicy":"mid-exam 30% + mini project report 30% + programming 20% + activity in the class 20%","materials":"1.
