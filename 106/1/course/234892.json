They are gradually replacing induction motor and widely used in industry.\nThis course begins with the theory of basic electromagnetic energy conversion, followed by the modeling and vector control theory for permanent-magnet synchronous motor, design and control of brushless dc motors, and the driving circuit design for these motors. Finally, sensorless PM machine control techniques are introduced.","schedule":"1. Electromagnetic energy conversion\n2. PM and magnetic circuit, BLDC basics\n3. Stator and rotor design\n4.
