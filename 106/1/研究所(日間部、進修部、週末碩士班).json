Are his writings not difficult and more or less inaccessible? Does it not require special training, time and long-term investment to appreciate Shakespeare? Well, the answer might be yes and no. Like it or not, Shakespeare is everywhere in contemporary culture. As Paul Prescott has pointed out, “His presence is not confined to the ‘official’ locations of classrooms, universities and theatres, but permeates popular mass media such as cinema, television, tabloid journalism, computer games, pop music, comics and advertisements.” Indeed, Shakespeare has long been an inescapable icon. His words, characters, and plots have been widely appropriated to appear across a range of popular mass media. This course is designed to introduce Shakespeare to those who are interested in appropriating Shakespeare for various purposes, including teaching and learning English through what Douglas Lanier has called “Shakespop.” To appreciate the complexit"},"id":"236088","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"職英文所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=106&sem=1&code=2249","code":"2249"}],"teacher":[{"name":"余盛延","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=106&sem=1&code=10465","code":"10465"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["A","B","C"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"共同401","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=106&sem=1&code=120","code":"120"}],"people":"13","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5425608","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=236088&code=10465"]},{"code":"5807055","name":{"zh":"設計研究與創作專題(三)","en":"The Research and Practice on Design Issues (III)"},"description":{"zh":"接續設計研究與創作專題(二)，本課程針對特定設計議題，導引學生應用研究與設計理論，並透過適當研究與設計方法探討其潛在的問題與有效的解決方法。議題主要針對：產品、空間、資訊、機構識別等設計行銷與服務設計、評量與管理等項目之研究與創作。課程研習結果可望作為研究生進階研究或設計創作之重要基礎。","en":"In continuing the study of “The Research and Practice on Design Issues (II)”, the course focuses on specific design issues, and directs students to apply proper theories and methods in research and design in order to explore critical problems and to provide effective solutions.
