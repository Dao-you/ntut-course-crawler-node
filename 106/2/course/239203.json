The procedure of FEM for engineering problems is introduced in both theory and programming. This course may benefit the students making a basic understanding of FEM.","schedule":"Week 1  Introduction\nWeek 2  Mathematical Preliminaries (I)\nWeek 3  Mathematical Preliminaries (II)\nWeek 4  Review of Elasticity\nWeek 5  Equivalent Integral Statements of Differential Equation\nWeek 6  2nd-Order D.E. in 1-D Problem: FEM --- Theory\nWeek 7  2nd-Order D.E. in 1-D Problem: FEM --- Programming\nWeek 8  Beams and Frames --- Theory\nWeek 9  Midterm\nWeek 10  Beams and Frames --- Programming (I)\nWeek 11  Beams and Frames --- Programming (II)\nWeek 12  Triangular Element in 2-D Problem --- Theory \nWeek 13  Triangular Element in 2-D Problem --- Programming\nWeek 14  Quadrilateral Element in 2-D Problem --- Theory\nWeek 15  Quadrilateral Element in 2-D Problem --- Programming\nWeek 16  Term Project (I)\nWeek 17  Term Project (II)\nWeek 18  Final","scorePolicy":"Midterm --- 20%\nFinal --- 30%\nTerm Project --- 20%\nHomework --- 20%","materials":"An Introduction to the Finite Element Method, 3nd Edition, by J.N.
