Then, the modern quantum chemistry will be introduced to make students familiarized the modern chemistry approach on the interpretation of the physical chemistry phenomena in material and biological science. This includes the introduction to quantum world, Schrodinger equation, chemical bonding, molecular shape and structure and so on. Later, the thermodynamics be applied to the interpretation of  physical and chemical equilibrium, acids and bases, aqueous equilibrium and electrochemistry.","schedule":"week 1 The shape of molecules\nweek 2  Theory of Covalent Bonding-Molecular Orbital Theory\nweek 3  The Transition Elements and Their Coordination Compounds (I)\nweek 4  The Transition Elements and Their Coordination Compounds (II)\nweek 5 Gas Kinetic Theory\nweek 6 Gas Kinetic Theory\nweek 7  Intermolecular Forces: Liquids, Solids, and Phase Changes\nweek 8  The properties of Mixtures: Solutions and Colloids\nweek 9  Midterm\nweek 10  Rates and Mechanisms of Chemical Reactions(I)\nweek 11 Rates and Mechanisms of Chemical Reactions(II)\nweek 12 Thermodynamics : Entropy, Free Energy, and the Direction of Chemical Reactions (I)\nweek 13 Thermodynamics : Entropy, Free Energy, and the Direction of Chemical Reactions (II)\nweek 14 Electrochemistry : Chemical Change and Electrical Work\nweek 15 Electrochemistry : Chemical Change and Electrical Work\nweek 16 Special Selected Topic (I)\nweek 17 Special Selected Topic (II)\nweek 18 Final Exam.","scorePolicy":"(1) 期中考 : 40%\n(2) 期末考:  40%\n(3) 平時成績: 20%","materials":"Textbook : Martin S.
