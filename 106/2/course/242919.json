It includes the solution thermodynamics and chemical microstructure of polymer chains. The solution thermodynamics is to study lattice theory, statistical thermodynamics, Flory-Huggin theory, Flory-Krigbaum theory, phase separation, θ-temperature, Osmometry, GPC, and polymer gels. Light scattering and Neutron scattering are used to characterize the polymer microstructure. Polymer radius of gyration, freely rotating chains, excluded volume, fractal, and scaling are also discussed. Finally, spectroscopy methods are used to study polymerization models and microstructure","schedule":"Chapter 1 Polymer Histry and Introduction         (1 wk)\nChapter 2 Polymer solution and conformation        (1 wk)\nChapter 3 Polymer solid physics                   (2 wk)\nChapter 4   Polymer Thermal Property (2 wks)\nChapter 5-Viscosity (2 wks)\nMid-term Exam\nChapter 6 Polymer Processing (1 wk)\nChapter 6 (b) Extrusion and Compounding (1 wk)\nChapter7 Composite Materials (1 wk)\nChapter 9 Fracture Mechanics (1 wk)\nChapter 10 Special topic on polymer blend &amp; compounding (1 wk)\nChapter 13 Rubber Elasticity (1 wk)\nFinal Reports","scorePolicy":"Mid term: 30 %\nFinal report (including report) : 40 %\nAttendance: 30 %","materials":"power point (mainly)\n\nHandout is available  in each lecture.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
