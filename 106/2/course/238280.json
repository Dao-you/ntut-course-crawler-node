The works we’ll read and think about would today collectively be considered “diverse”. I’ll decide on individual texts week-by- week so you’ll have to consult the i-upload page every week. You don’t have to like everything we read or think that everything we read is important, but influences aside from and in addition to the traditional Western canon appeared during this era and have had influence (for good or ill) on some people.","scorePolicy":"Mid-Term Exam (multiple choice and short answer) 40%\nFinal Exam 50% (multiple choice and short answer) 50%\n1 or 2 paragraphs on any work (because I want to know what you are thinking) 10%","materials":"Kafka Influence of Judaic Bible\nFreud Psychoanalysis\nHighsmith Misogyny\nHitchcock Film as Art: Vertigo\nDuras Love and Intimacy\nRossi Love, Intimacy, Politics\nGenet/Fassbinder Gay Aesthetics: Querelle\n\nWarhol Pop Aesthetics\nSolanus Misandry\nAgemben Art, Politics, Institutions\nKushner Response to AIDS crisis: Angels in America","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
