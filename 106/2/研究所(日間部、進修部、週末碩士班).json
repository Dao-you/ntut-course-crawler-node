Worldwide government are taking measures to tackle this issue and outlining strategies to bring the greenhouse effect under control.Greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan are mainly from burning fossil fuels such as crude oil, coal and LPG and the energy imports have reached 99.22%. Therefore, the sustainable development in any country is to increase the proportion of self-generation of energy, reduce the emission of GHGs, and balance among Economic Growth, Environment Protection and Energy Supply.Green energy (Renewable energy) covers the fields of solar and wind energy, biofuels which includes biodiesel and bioethanol, hydrogen energy and fuel cell, geothermal and ocean energy as well as clean coal combustion technologies (IGCC). Balancing development of '3E' can be achieved by developing green energy industries and which is also the goal every count"},"id":"239886","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"化工所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=106&sem=2&code=2223","code":"2223"}],"teacher":[{"name":"左峻德","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=106&sem=2&code=23902","code":"23902"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["A","B","C"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"化工101","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=106&sem=2&code=399","code":"399"}],"people":"17","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"日職合開","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=7305072","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=239886&code=23902"]},{"code":"7805004","name":{"zh":"專題研討(一)","en":"Engineering Seminar(Ｉ）"},"description":{"zh":"專題報告、專題演講、研究小組討論。","en":"Case Study.

The course considers how the large-scale properties of solid materials result from their atomic-scale properties, through methods of quantum mechanics, crystallography, electromagnetism and metallurgy. The first part of this course is to introduce the foundations of quantum mechanics and statistics, including wave-particle duality, expectation value and measurement, eigenstates, boson and fermion. Secondly, we will explain some simple cases about mesoscopic physics of nano-structure materials, including free electron in 1D 2D and 3D, quantum slabs, quantum wires and quantum dots, tunneling and transition problems, transport theory and noise, quantum optics, many body effects and introductory group theory.
