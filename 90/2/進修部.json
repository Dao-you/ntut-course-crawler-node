In addition, the course also includes the loop shaping concept and the loop transfer recovery (LTR) technique which are frequently used in the modern control."},"id":"58995","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"職電機研所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=90&sem=2&code=466","code":"466"}],"teacher":[{"name":"謝清志","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=90&sem=2&code=21570","code":"21570"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["A","B","C"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"10","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105036","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"4215005","name":{"zh":"工程品質與管理","en":"Engineering Quality and Management"},"description":{"zh":"本課程主要探討土木工程施工品質的內容，並藉由諸如統計品管，QC七大手法，ISO9000等品管技能與精義，探討改進工程品質，防止土木災害的相關技術。","en":"This course will discuss the construction quality of civil engineering in detail.Form the learning of statistical quality,QC seven tools and ISO 9000,students can understand how to improve the quality and prevent the accident of civil engineering."},"id":"59023","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"職防災研所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=90&sem=2&code=469","code":"469"}],"teacher":[{"name":"林利國","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=90&sem=2&code=10239","code":"10239"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["A","B","C"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"土木203","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=90&sem=2&code=123","code":"123"}],"people":"7","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=4215005","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"3205002","name":{"zh":"高等熱傳遞","en":"Advanced Heat transfer"},"description":{"zh":"基本熱傳機構，穩態與非穩態熱傳導其包括有內部熱源之系統。內部及外部之強制及自然對流。表面及氣體間之輻射。利用因次方法及邊界層來考量熱傳。","en":"Basic heat transfers mechanisms.
