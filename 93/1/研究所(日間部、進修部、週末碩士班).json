It has developed rapidly over the past decade. The reason for the recent advances in structural geology has been the realization that naturally deformed rocks seen in field outcrops contain a fantastic range of small-scale features which relate directly to large-scale orogenic deformation systems. The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course. Systematic study of this advanced structural geology course includes several topics: mechanic proporties and deformation behaviors of rocks, strain analysis, ductile geologic structures, brittle geologic structures, and applied structural geology."},"id":"81953","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"材資所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=93&sem=1&code=771","code":"771"}],"teacher":[{"name":"羅偉","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=93&sem=1&code=11170","code":"11170"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["2","3","4"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"6","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3325133","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=81953&code=11170"]},{"code":"5807032","name":{"zh":"室內設計數位化研究","en":"Study of Digitizied Interior Design"},"description":{"zh":"本課程旨在研究室內設計數位化的技巧，藉由各種相關軟體與自行建立Third Party的應用，完成室內設計案虛擬實境的效果，同時以室內設計個案的實際演練，達到室內設計師與客戶間的良好溝通與充分檢討。","en":"This course aims to study the digital techniques for interior design.
