These popular thoughts influence the livelihood, the society and the direction of national development. So contemporary thoughts plays an important role in national development. Such contemporary thoughts and national development are the key contents of this course.The ideal of such thoughts as Racism, Nationalism, and Cosmopolitanism differ from each other, so they have a different effect on national policy decision. Nationalism and Communism influence the political system of the nation and the lifestyle of its citizens.
