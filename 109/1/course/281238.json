Practical case studies in the design of optical components and systems will help students become an optical consultant who has the ability to solve problems, especially for wave optics.\nStudents will learn commercial optical software Rsoft and COMSOL, which are commonly used in the industry, to simulate the assigned cases studies for modern optics including optical communication, photosensitive materials, and nano-optical structures.\nFinally, students are required to autonomy to design, plan, execute, analyze and implement their research ideas to others. There are two ways to presenting their final research results: poster presentations or oral presentations.","schedule":"Ｗeek1: Opening week: introduction to the modern optics \nＷeek2:  industrial case studies from Cybernet(思渤科技) lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Mr. Richard \nＷeek3:  Case study and group discussion for the case studies raised from Cybernet Co. \nＷeek4: Industrial case studies from PitoTech(皮托科技) lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Dr. Jason Lin\nＷeek5: Case study and group discussion for the case studies raised from PitoTech Co. \nＷeek6:　　Simulation exercise\nＷeek7:　　Metalens tutorials　　lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Mr. Richard \nＷeek8:　　Metalens tutorials II lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Mr. Richard \nＷeek9: Midterm report I\nＷeek10: Midterm report II\nＷeek11: Nonlinear Metalens　　 lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Dr. Jason Lin\nＷeek12:　　 Nonlinear response for Au-coated LCE lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Dr. Jason Lin\nＷeek13:　　Case study and group discussion With Dr. Jason Lin\nＷeek14:　　Case study and group discussion With Prof. Yu-Chieh Cheng\nＷeek15:　　Case study and group discussion With Prof. Yu-Chieh Cheng\nＷeek16:        Case study and group discussion With Mr. Richard\nＷeek17:　　Case study and group discussion With Dr. Jason Lin\nＷeek18:　　Final presentations","scorePolicy":"Exercise and discussion in class 20%\nFinal presentation 50%\nHomework 30%","materials":"Journal papers and others","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
