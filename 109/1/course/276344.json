It can guide students to have knowledge of process technology through basic common sense and professional terminology, can gradually feel familiar and close to this field, and can have the basic ability to collaborate with process technology engineers.  Course content includes engineering materials, engineering graphics, tolerances and fits, heat treatment, measuring tools, jigs, traditional manufacturing procedures such as casting , forging, machining, assembly, and advanced manufacturing procedures used for SMT IC PCB and so on.\n\nWe will try to  help students to become interested in the design, operation, and management of the manufacturing system composed of process technology and develop into a professional.\n\nThis course arrangement will help to reinforce course such as IEM introduction and Work Study that have been taken, and will help the follow-up study of quality management, production management, facility planning and other courses.","schedule":"本課程教學  將輔以大量的線上影音教材及翻譯軟體。  並含組裝實作。\nThe teaching of this course will be supplemented by a large number of online audiovisual materials and translation software.
