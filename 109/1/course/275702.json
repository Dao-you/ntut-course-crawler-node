Combining the idea of quantization and the semi-classical hydrogen model of Bohr, the structure of atom is described. Solving the Schrodinger equation, the deduced wave function is related to the probability of finding the electron in space, a particle in the potential well and in a box. The concept of atom is expanded to the molecular and the energy band theory of solid state physics. The energy band theory deduced from the modern physics is applied to account the optical, electrical and thermal properties of solid states, wherefore the fundamental principles.","schedule":"Chapter 2 波的粒子特性\nChapter 3 粒子的波特性\nChapter 4 原子結構\nChapter 5 量子力學\nChapter 6 氫原子的量子理論\nChapter 7 多電子原子\nChapter 8 分子\nChapter 9 統計力學\nChapter 10 固態","scorePolicy":"Home work 30%\nMidterm exam 30%\nFinal exam 30%\nReport presentation 10%","materials":"Concepts of Modern Physics - Arthur Beiser","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
