Among them, slope stabilization is a particularly important field because of the frequent occurrence of soil erosion, debris flows and landslides in Taiwan. This course will provide an opportunity for students to familiarize themselves with this important field and gain relevant knowledge and insight. We will explore the two main causes of slope degradation, which are soil erosion and landslide. Then, we will explain the fundamental concepts of biotechnical and soil bioengineering and how to apply these concepts to slope stabilization and erosion control. This course will be taught in Chinese. No prerequisite is needed.","schedule":"Week 01: Introduction and key concepts\nWeek 02: Principal of biotechnical and soil bioengineering \nWeek 03: Surface erosion and mass movement \nWeek 04: Universal soil loss equation\nWeek 05: RUSLE\nWeek 06: WEPP and other soil erosion models\nWeek 07: Vegetation to prevent soil erosion\nWeek 08: Case studies\nWeek 09: midterm exam\nWeek 10: Slope failures\nWeek 11: Translational slides\nWeek 12: Ordinary method of slice\nWeek 13: SWASE\nWeek 14: STABL\nWeek 15: Mechanics of roots\nWeek 16: Vegetation to prevent landslides\nWeek 17: Case studies\nWeek 18: Final exam","scorePolicy":"Homework/quiz/reports/class participation 40%\nMidterm exam 30%\nFinal exam 30%","materials":"1.
