Methods of advanced fluid dynamics in the analysis of boundary layer theory in practical cases will also be explored. Topics such as the Navier-Stokes equation, energy equations, boundary layers and separation, mass conservation, dimensional analysis, circulation and vorticity, turbulence flow, swirling flow, advanced flow measurements and their corresponding industrial applications will be discussed.   Prospective students need to have a prior understanding of the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and its applications.  A better understanding of advanced fluid mechanics can be beneficial to a student’s future career whether in industry or academic research.","schedule":"　　Conservation equations for viscous fluids. \n　　Boundary layer theory.　　 \n　　boundary layer concept and Laminar boundary layer equations.   \n　　Navier-Stokes equations.  \n　　Constitutive relations and the Navier-Stokes equation for Newtonian fluids. 　　\n　　Analytical solutions of the transient and steady Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous flows.\n　　Von Karman momentum integral equation.  \n　　Theory of stability of laminar flows.   \n　　Introduction to turbulent flow.　　\n　　Stability and transition to turbulence.  \n　　Derivation of RANS equations; turbulent shear flows.\n　　Swirling flow. 　　\n　　Reynolds transport theorem.　　\n　　Compressible Flows.\n　　Advanced flow measurements.","scorePolicy":"Homework 30%\nClass participation 10%\nPresentation 10%\nMidterm exam 20%\nFinal exam 30%","materials":"•　　Advanced Fluid Mechanics, W.
