To achieve this goal, students in this course read various kinds of articles and formulate their own critical thinking. With the experience of critical reading and thinking, students will develop their own writing strategies and write three short critical essays (500-800 words) with different rhetorical modes: comparison-contrast, cause-and-effect, and argumentative. \n     Basic knowledge and skills of conducting research will be integrated into the course; students will learn how to search for relevant sources, adopt proper academic styles, and avoid plagiarism. Towards the end of the semester, students will decide a research topic and write a research proposal and working bibliography to prepare for the longer researched essay (1500-2000 words) in the spring term.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction to the course\n\nWeek 2: Review the organization of an essay: introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion\n              Review the concepts of unity and coherence\n\nWeek 3: Quiz 1: unity and coherence\n              Review language and grammar: clauses and run-on sentence and fragment \n\nWeek 4: Discuss the article and Exercises 3 and 4 (EAW 39)\n             Activity: freewriting of comparison and contrast\n             Lecture: comparison and contrast essay: signal words and organization\n\nWeek 5: Quiz 2: clauses and run-on sentence\n              Discuss the article and Exercises 8 (EAW 50)\n              Discuss students’ topic and thesis statement\n              Review language and grammar: relative clauses\n\nWeek 6: Discuss the article \"Two Ways of Viewing the River” (handout)\n              Discuss students’ outlines\n             Introduction to academic styles\n\nWeek 7: Quiz 3: relative clauses\n              Peer review: how to use track changes and annotation on Word\n              Lecture: cause-and-effect essay\n             Quotation: MLA style\n\nWeek 8: Discuss the article and exercise 2 (EAW 88)\n              Works Cited: MLA style\n              Review language and grammar: cause connectors and effect connectors\n\nWeek 9: Mid-term exam\n\nWeek 10: Discuss the article “Some Lessons from the Assembly Line” (handout) and exercises \n               Discuss students’ topics and thesis statements\n               Review language and grammar: conditional sentences\n\nWeek 11: Discuss the mid-term exam\n               Discuss students’ outlines\n               Lecture: argumentative essay\n              Quiz 4: conditional sentences\n\nWeek 12: discuss the article and Exercise 11 (EAW 117-118)\n               Effective summary (EAW 114)\n              Rhetorical focus (EAW 124)\n              Review language and grammar: connectors (EAW 126)\n\nWeek 13: Discuss the article “Judging by the Cover” (handout)\n               Quiz 5: connectors\n              Review language and grammar: clauses\n\nWeek 14: Discuss students’ topics and thesis statements\n                Review language and grammar: gerund and infinitives\n\nWeek 15: Discuss students’ outline\n                Discuss the article “Rethinking the Voting Age” (handout)\n               Quiz 6: gerunds and infinitives\n\nWeek 16: Review language and grammar: passives\n               Rhetorical focus: literary present\n               How to write a research proposal\n\nWeek 17: Discuss the article “Harry Potter Casts His Spell in the Classroom” (handout)\n                Discuss the students’ topics\n                Research topic, the problematic, methodology, literature review","scorePolicy":"Class attendance and participation (in-class exercises): 10%\n6 quizzes: 20%\nMidterm exam: 20%\n3 short essays and 1 research proposal: 40%\nPeer-reviews: 10%","materials":"Liss, Rhonda and Jason Davis.
