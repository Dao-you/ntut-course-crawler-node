A review of grammatical ideas at high level is reinforced by correcting sentence errors, and revising awkward usage of words or sentence structures. The main subjects include English sentence structures, verbal usages, conjunctions, and sequences. Related topics for class discussion cover direct and indirect speech, sentence transformation and modification of sentences; (b) The second half of the course focuses on English rhetoric--principles of effective written and spoken communication. Topics for class discussion include reference, coherence, reverse structures and some related rhetorical concepts. It is hoped that the students will know better the significance brought about by the variations of different expressions that occur in the similar linguistic contexts.","schedule":"Week 1  Course Introduction\nWeek 2  Overview of Verb Tenses I\nWeek 3  Overview of Verb Tenses II \nWeek 4  Subject-Verb Agreement\nWeek 5  Nouns\nWeek 6  Pronouns\nWeek 7  Modal, Part 1\nWeek 8  Modal, Part 2\nWeek 9  Midterm Exam\nWeek 10　　The Passive\nWeek 11　　Adjective Clauses\nWeek 12　　Gerunds and Infinitives, Part 1\nWeek 13　　Gerunds and Infinitives, Part 2\nWeek 14　　Coordinating Conjunctions\nWeek 15　　Adverb Clauses\nWeek 16　　No Class\nWeek 17　　Reduction of Adverb Clauses to Modifying Adverbial Phrases\nWeek 18　　Final Exam","scorePolicy":"Class Attendance &amp; Participation: 15%\nAssignments 15%\nQuizzes 30%\nMidterm exam 20%\nFinal exam 20%","materials":"Azar, B.
