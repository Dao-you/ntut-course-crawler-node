The three fundamental components of laser: resonator, active medium, and pumping method are explained. Also the types, characteristics, and applications of various laser are introduced.","schedule":"Introduction (1 week)\nLaser Resonators &amp; Laser Applications  (1 week)\nRay Tracing: ABCD Matrix  (1 week)\nStable Resonator &amp; Diffraction  (1 week)\nGaussian Spherical Waves  (1 week)\nCavity Modes &amp; Mode Frequencies  (2 week)\nMidterm Exam  \nFabry-Perot Interferometer  (1 week)\nRate Equation  (2 week)\nLaser Operation  (1 week)\nGroup report  (3 week)\nFinal Exam","scorePolicy":"Homework: 15%  \nMidterm: 35%   \nFinal: 35%   \nOthers: 15%","materials":"Lasers, A.
