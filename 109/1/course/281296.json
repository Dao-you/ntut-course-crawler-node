The object of this course is to teach how to apply the C programming language to develop real application systems. The contents of this course include advanced pointer usage, pointer and array, pointer and data structure, pointer-to-pointer, function pointer, callback functions, bitwise operations, and so on. In addition to practice on PC, this course also offers case studies for better understanding. Students will also be required to implement emulators to simulate OS lower level operations, e.g., CPU scheduling and memory management.","schedule":"Week 1: C review\nWeek 2: Pointer and array\nWeek 3: Pointer and structure\nWeek 4: Linked list applications\nWeek 5: Linked list applications\nWeek 6: Linked list applications\nWeek 7: Linked list applications (Project 1)\nWeek 8: Preprocessor/makefile\nWeek 9: Pointer to pointer applications\nWeek 10: Pointer to pointer applications\nWeek 11: Function pointer and callback function\nWeek 12: Declarations\nWeek 13: Declarations\nWeek 14: Bitwise operations\nWeek 15: Applications to memory management\nWeek 16: Graph \nWeek 17: Graph (Project 2)\nWeek 18: Hashing","scorePolicy":"In class program quiz: 70%\nProjects: 30%","materials":"Slides (will announce every week)","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
