In the beginning of this course, digital-time signals, systems, and transforms are reviewed. Also, digital filter design including FIR and IIR filters are presented. Then, application implementation on speech, audio, and image processing is introduced. Last, labs on some DSP algorithms are performed on C28xx DSPs.","schedule":"Week1 ：數位訊號與系統簡介\nWeek2 ： Z轉換\nWeek3 ：離散時間傅立葉轉換\nWeek4 ：取樣定理\nWeek5 ：離散傅立葉轉換\nWeek6 ：數位系統實現\nWeek7 : TMS320C2000系列概述\nWeek8 : 整合開發環境CCS\nWeek9 ：期中考 \nWeek10 ：記憶配置與CMD文件\nWeek11 ：IQ Math介紹\nWeek12 ：快速傅立葉轉換\nWeek13 ：有限脈衝響應濾波器設計\nWeek14 ：無限脈衝響應濾波器設計\nWeek15 ：計時器與中斷\nWeek16 ：脈寬調變\nWeek17 ：類比數位轉換\nWeek18 ：期末專題\n\nWeek1 ：Introduction to DSP\nWeek2 ： Z transform\nWeek3 ：Discrete-Time Fourier Transform\nWeek4 ：Sampling theory\nWeek5 ：Discrete Fourier Transform\nWeek6 ：Implementation of Discrete Systems\nWeek7 : TMS320C2000 Introduction\nWeek8 : CCS\nWeek9 ：Mid-term\nWeek10 ：Memory allocation and CMD File\nWeek11 ：IQ Math\nWeek12 ：FFT\nWeek13 ：FIR\nWeek14 ：IIR\nWeek15 ：Timer and Interrupt\nWeek16 ：PWM\nWeek17 ：ADC\nWeek18 ：Final project","scorePolicy":"期中報告(20%)\n實驗作業(40%)\n期末報告(40%)\n\nMid-term report (20%)\nLab (40%)\nFinal project (40%)","materials":"台達電磨課師線上影片\nDELTA MOOCX online videos","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
