These applications can include but not limited to measurement, structural health monitoring, and safety identification. \n\nThis course not only introduces the theory of computer vision and image measurement, but also guides students to operate and implement structural experiments and measurement projects. Students are encouraged to bring up the concepts and theories, programming skills, experimental design and implementation, oral presentations, as well as experimental documentation and technical writing ability.","schedule":"1.
