It is also a fact that those who take better advantage of the right brain are very likely to be straightforward and thus seemingly more mechanical and unsympathetic. Economics can be seen as the mother of science under the condition that rational efficiency-as well as the socially humanity--are kept at the same time. As a matter of act, the economic trainings share the same goal as what is required by the General Education courses.\nThe first priority of the course is to highly motivate the students in the economic issues. We do our best to avoid too much weight generally put into teaching economics, leading to poor learning and teaching experience. Cases are studied in such a way that students will recognize the \"real purpose of studying.\"  Real cases and examples are brought into discussion. We guide the students to\"feel\"the problems.","schedule":"Week 1-3：Introduction &amp; course overview 課程及參考資料概述、導論\nWeek 4-6：Principles of economics 經濟學原理\nWeek 7-9：Demand-supply &amp; market equilibrium 供需及市場均衡\nWeek 10：Midterm exam  期中考\nWeek 11-12：Elasticity and its applications 彈性及其運用 \nWeek 13-15：National income 國民所得\nWeek 16-17：Price index and inflation 物價指數及通膨\nWeek 18：Final exam  期末考\n＊The instructor will adjust the progress and content based on students’ learning situation. 教師將視同學學習情況調整進度與內容","scorePolicy":"Attendance and Class Participation：40% 平時成績(出勤及參與討論)\nMidterm Exam：30% 期中考\nFinal Exam：30% 期末考\n＊To attend lectures is important.
