The theme of this course is to encourage students to participate in the discovery of laws and wonder of nature, and to solidate the foundation for the particular courses of study for different departments. The contents of this course include mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, optics, and foundation of modern physics, etc.. The lecturers will emphasize or abridge certain contents based on the individual needs of departments. For this course, there will be 3 credits for each of two semesters,  and 3 lecture hours per week.","schedule":"Week 1: ch1  Overview\nWeek 2:ch2   Motion in a Straight Line\nWeek 3: ch2   Motion in a Straight Line\nWeek 4: ch3  Motion in Two and Three Dimensions\nWeek 5: ch3   Motion in Two and Three Dimensions\nWeek 6: ch4  Force\nWeek 7: ch4  Force\nweek 8: ch5  Kinetic Energy, Work, and Power\nWeek 9: ch5  Kinetic Energy, Work, and Power\nWeek 10: Midterm examination\nweek 11: ch6  Potential Energy and Energy Conservation\nWeek 12: ch6  Potential Energy and Energy Conservation\nWeek 13: ch7   Momentum and Collisions\nWeek 14: ch7  Momentum and Collisions\nWeek 15: ch8  Systems of Particles and Extended Objects\nWeek 16: ch8  Systems of Particles and Extended Objects\nweek 17: ch9  Circular Motion\nWeek 18: ch9  Circular Motion and Final examination\nweek 19: check Final examination","scorePolicy":"Midterm examination (期中考) 30%\nfinal examination (期末考) 30%\nQuiz (小考及作業) 25%\nAttendance (出席率)及學習態度 15%","materials":"Textbook(課本):\n1.University Physics with Modern Physics and the related computer study (W.
