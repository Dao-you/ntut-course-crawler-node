Yet the stories of these dark ages – of Arthur and his knights, the Holy Grail, dragons and princesses – continue to be retold and enjoyed in modern books and films.  This course will examine the paradoxical phenomenon of modern medievalism, looking at the varied ways the modern West has borrowed, celebrated, and rewritten its medieval past, a culture strangely as alive now as it was a thousand years ago.  We will consider, too, how western medieval stories and images are also being cleverly adapted and transformed in modern Japanese pop culture by anime and manga artists.","schedule":"Week 　　1: 　　Introduction\n　　\n　　2-5:　　Unit 1　　\n\n6-8:　　Unit 2\n\n9:  　　Midterm\n\n10-13:  Unit 3\n　　\n　　14-17:  Unit 4\n\n　　18:　　Finals week","scorePolicy":"Grades: \n　　 　　Midterm  50%\n　　　　Final　　 50%\n\n\nAttendance: a combination of 4 absences or late days = -10 points from course grade","materials":"Course reader","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
