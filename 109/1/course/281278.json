Regarding the learning of spectral analysis, the fundamentals of statistics, the introduction of random signals, correlation functions, spectral density functions, and theoretical derivation spectral analysis for SDOF systems will be introduced. The training of system identification skills is also given, followed by commonly seen civil engineering examples.","schedule":"Week01/Common Probability Functions\nWeek02/Introduction to Probability Distributions and Averages\nWeek03/Joint Probability Distributions, Ensemble Averages\nWeek04/Correlation\nWeek05/Fourier Analysis\nWeek06/Spectral Density\nWeek07/Excitation – Response Relations for Linear Systems\nWeek08/Transmission of Random Vibration\nWeek09/Mid-term Exam\nWeek10/Statistics of Narrow Band Processes\nWeek11/Accuracy of Measurements\nWeek12/Digital Spectral Analysis I: Discrete Fourier Transforms\nWeek13/Digital Spectral Analysis II: Windows and Smoothing\nWeek14/SDOF Spectral Analysis\nWeek15/Structural system identification: frequency\nWeek16/Structural system identification: damping\nWeek17/Time series simulation: AR approach\nWeek18/Final Exam","scorePolicy":"Attendance: 10%\nMid-term Exam: 25%\nFinal Exam: 30%\nReport: 35%","materials":"\"An Introduction to Random Vibrations, Spectral &amp; Wavelet Analysis 3/e\" by D.
