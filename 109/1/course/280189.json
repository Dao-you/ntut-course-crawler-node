[{"name":"王聖銘","email":"ryan5885@gmail.com","latestUpdate":"2020-07-19 11:08:04","objective":"As the user-center design is becoming the core of most interaction design (IxD), it has become a popular belief that it is no longer the product that leads but users and user preferences that's leading the game. This is where design thinking steps in, where IxD uses their sensibility and methods to match users' need in a way that is technologically feasible and viable enough to generate user value and tap market opportunity. Suggested by some studies, brought in vogue by the popular design firm IDEO, design thinking when combined with decision science results in an infusion of empathy with engineering. This not only ensures a practical and creative resolution of problems but also puts the user at the center of applications and at the starting point to develop new designs and solutions. Meanwhile, ensuring design in analytics projects from the initial stages can lead to the right blend of sensibility, technical feasibility, business viability, and consumer needs.\nThe idea is, design thinking puts user and their needs as the starting point of developing new product and solution and ask questions like for whom are we designing, what is the problem user is experiencing, how to improve the performance and achieve scalability, among others. Data scientist and analyst can make up for great professionals in design thinking, given the right set of tools that is at their disposal.\nThus, the main objectives of this course provide: \n1.　　Creating a vital user-centered design process.\n2.　　Work with high-quality data, design artifacts can be created, addressing the needs of the real user.\n3.　　Encourage the student to mix these two together in IxD to reap design benefits and opportunities.\nThe most important objective is to ensure the quality of user-centricity of user experience.\n\n本課程的核心主軸，將利用史丹佛大學d.School所提出設計思考的方法，針對資料科學的關鍵知識進行跨領域的盤點、整理與設計，以創造其具人本設計(Human-Centered Design)的創新價值。\n\n本課程將採用專案/問題導向(Project/Problem-Based Learning)的學習與互動模式。因為是跨系選修的課程，將於課堂上組成跨領域的學習團隊，鼓勵跨領域的學生從不同的情境模式，連結「資料探勘」之核心課程。「類神經網路」與「深度學習」的進階課程，及「語音辨識與人機互動」的應用課程等相關內容。並同時應用於探討資料科學有關資料蒐集、建構、過濾、品質驗證、分類處理、模式應用、資料視覺化處理、及分析敘事的核心知識。並於課程操作過程中，透過「資料導向敘事(Data-Driven Storytelling)」的方法，呈現跨領域創新學習的成果。","schedule":"Week01 \nDevelopment of Human-Centric Artificial Intelligent\n1.　　The basic of AI\n2.　　Value of Human-centered Design)\nThe trend of inter-disciplinary integration and development \n\nWeek02\nDesign Thinking and the Values of Data Collecting and Generation\n1.
