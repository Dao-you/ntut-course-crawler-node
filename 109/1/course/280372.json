Knowing a culture’s stories helps one to understand that culture and talk with its people. However, cross-cultural encounters are not always of harmony and mutual respect. Throughout the human history, violence, domination, and exploitation have pervaded these encounters. To reflect upon this phenomenon, this course will focus on the appropriation, representation, revision, and sometimes distortion of a culture by another culture, the power relations between different cultures, and the construction/deconstruction of identity in cross-cultural narratives. The works we will read and discuss include Lord Byron’s The Giaour, Joseph Conrad’s “An Outpost of Progress,” Rudyard Kipling’s “The Man Who Would Be King,” and Henry James’s Daisy Miller, along with critical essays on them. Following a chronological order from the eighteenth century to the twentieth century, the course will also introduce basic ideas of important historical phases in English literature, namely the Romantic and Victorian periods, and the age of Modernism.","schedule":"9/18 　　Introduction to the course: culture and narrative\n        Discussion of paintings by Eugene Delacroix and Giulio Rosati\n\n9/25 　　Edward Said’s introduction to Orientalism  \n       　　John Gabriel Stedman’s Narrative with William Blake’s and Francesco Bartolozzi’s  \n    　　Illustrations\n\nThe Romantic Imagination of the East:\n\n10/16 　　Film viewing: excerpts from BBC's Byron\n                Lord Byron: The Giaour, lines 1-786\n10/23 　　Lord Byron: The Giaour, lines 787-1334\n               Critical essay: Jon Nichols: “Lord Byron’s The Giaour”: More than a Mere     \n               Orientalist Curio”\n\nColonialism in the Victorian Era:\n\n10/30  Joseph Conrad: “An Outpost of Progress”, Chapter 1\n11/6   Joseph Conrad: “An Outpost of Progress”, Chapter 2\n          Critical essay: Thais Rutledge: “Formed by Place: Spatiality, Irony, and Empire    \n             in Conrad’s ‘An Outpost of Progress’” \n\n11/13  Rudyard Kipling: “The Man Who Would Be King”\n11/20 Rudyard Kipling: “The Man Who Would Be King”\n           Critical essay: Sharleen Mondal: “Whiteness, Miscegenation, and Anti-Colonial   \n     　　　　 Rebellion in Rudyard Kipling’s The Man Who Would be King” \n\n11/27 Film viewing: Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nAmerican-European Encounter and Gender:\n\n12/4 　　Henry James: Daisy Miller, Chapter 1 \n12/11 Henry James: Daisy Miller, Chapter 2\n12/18 Henry James: Daisy Miller, Chapter 3\n         Final paper: research topic due\n12/25 Henry James: Daisy Miller, Chapter 4\n          Critical essay: Lisa Johnson’s “Daisy Miller: Cowboy Feminist”\n　　  Final paper: working bibliography due\n\n1/8  Film viewing: The Portrait of a Lady (1996)\n       Final paper: research proposal due\n 　　　　　　　　\n1/15　　Final paper: mock conference","scorePolicy":"Attendance/participation in class: 10%\nPresentation of the critical essays: 20%\nPresentation in the mock conference: 30%\nFinal paper: 40%","materials":"Conrad, Joseph.
