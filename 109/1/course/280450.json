In the class, we will learn about the basic principles and some advanced topics of OFDM and MIMO. We will also learn how to write a MATLAB program to evaluate the performance of a communication system. All students taking this class have to study a special topic on OFDM or MIMO as a final project.","schedule":"Week 01. Elements of digital communication system\nWeek 02.
