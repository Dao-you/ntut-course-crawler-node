It emphasizes modern statistical methods and data analysis using real data and examples to offer students exposure to practical applications.  This course will provide an opportunity to learn how probabilistic analysis and statistical reasoning and testing can be applied to a wide range of problems in civil engineering.  Topics to be covered will include data analysis, probability, random variables, probability distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, sampling, linear regression, statistical process control and analysis of variance.","schedule":"1.　　Introduction.\n2.　　Collection and analysis of information.\n3.　　Probability models.\n4.　　Continuous probability models.\n5.　　Applications of sampling distribution theory.\n6.　　Statistical quality control.\n7.　　Tests of statistical hypotheses.\n8.　　Experiments with one factor.\n9.　　Experiments with two factors.\n10.　　Regression Analysis","scorePolicy":"Report:　　　　35%\n　　Final:　　　　45%\n　　Homework:　　20%","materials":"Applied Statistics for Engineers &amp; Physical Scientists 3/E, Ledolter and Hoogg, 2010, Pearson Education.\nIntroductory Statistics 9/E, Weiss, N.A., 2012, Pearson Education.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
