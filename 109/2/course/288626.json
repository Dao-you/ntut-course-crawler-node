The 17 SDGs came into effect in January 2016, and they will continue to guide UNDP policy and funding until 2030. This course aims to explore alternative conceptions and theoretical underpinnings of the notion of “sustainable development.” It focuses on the sustainability problems of industrial countries, especially in Taiwan such as aging of populations, sustainable consumption, etc. It intends to use IPDD approach systematically to explore the sociology of knowledge around sustainability, the economic and technological dimensions a","schedule":"This course aims to help postgraduate students developing several fundamental skills associated with conducting scientific research. In particular, it aims to improve the ability of students to plan, design, manage and execute scientific research whilst providing opportunities for formative assessment and rapid feedback.
