It covers the basic knowledge of the atmospheric boundary layer, bluff-body aerodynamics, aero-elasticity, the wind-resistant design of buildings, and the concept of wind-resistant design of bridges. National and international wind codes for buildings and bridges are introduced with the practices based on wind tunnel test data.","schedule":"W01/Introduction\nW02/Review of Dynamics of Structures I\nW03/Review of Dynamics of Structures II\nW04/Atmospherical Boundary Layer\nW05/Basic Design Wind Speed\nW06/Bluff-Body Aerodynamics\nW07/Review of Spectral Analysis I\nW08/Review of Spectral Analysis II\nW09/Mid-term Exam (Written Test)\nW10/Wind Tunnel Visiting (Tamkang University)\nW11/Wind-Resistant Design of Tall Buildings I\nW12/Wind-Resistant Design of Tall Buildings II\nW13/Wind-Resistant Design of Tall Buildings III\nW14/Wind-Resistant Design of Tall Buildings IV\nW15/Wind-Resistant Design of Bridges I\nW16/Wind-Resistant Design of Bridges II\nW17/Wind-Resistant Design of Bridges III\nW18/Final Exam (Final Report Submission)","scorePolicy":"Attendance 15%\nClass Performance 20%\nMid-term Exam 30%\nFinal Report 35%","materials":"1.
