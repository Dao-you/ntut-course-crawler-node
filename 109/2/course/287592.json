The goals of this course are three-fold: (1) To educate students about the underlying natural process that give rise to hazards. (2) To emphasize how society evaluates and confronts the dangers posed by these natural processes from a political, social, and ethical perspective. (3) Expose students to the technological innovations that are allowing an increasing large human population to monitor, predict, and warn society about natural hazards and impending disasters. Case studies of recent and past natural disasters will be discussed. This course is designed for students without an extensive background in science or math and can be used to partly satisfy minor programs in Environmental Geosciences.","schedule":"2/24: Self-introduction, Q&amp;A\n3/3: Earth system processes\n3/10: Chains of disaster occurrences\n3/17-3/24: Classification of disasters\n3/31: Application of geomatics tech in disaster mapping, mitigation, assessment, and management\n4/7: Make-up from the Sports Day\n4/14: MIDTERM EXAM\n4/21: Case study – Love Canal\n4/28: Case study – Ok Tedi environmental disaster\n5/5: Case study – Bhopal disaster\n5/12: Case study – Chernobyl disaster\n5/19: Case study – Deepwater Horizon oil spill\n5/26: Case study – Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n6/2: FINAL EXAM\n6/9-6/16: Oral presentations\n6/25: Deadline for written reports","scorePolicy":"5%　　Submission of project topic and summary\n10%　　Literature review\n20%　　Midterm exam\n20%　　Final exam\n20%　　Final oral report (5% Slide design，8% Details of contents，7%Presentation skills)\n20%　　Final written report (10% Conformity to academic formats，10% Completeness of contents)\n5%　　Attendances","materials":"Materials summarized by the lecturer","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
