This course is a calculus-based introduction to statistics, and so designed to help students learn the introductory descriptive and inferential statistical procedures that are used in diverse areas. Mainly, this course deals with the basic concepts of statistical inference and linear models. After a review of descriptive statistics and some necessary probability distributions, interval and point estimation, hypothesis tests, linear regression analysis, ANOVA, and factorial designs are illustrated and accompanied by practical/theoretical exercises.","schedule":"Week 1 Introduction to probability distribution, sampling distribution, and estimation\nWeek 2 Decision making for a single sample – Estimation, hypothesis testing, inference on the mean of a population\nWeek 3 Decision making for a single sample – Inference on the variance of a normal population, inference on a population proportion, goodness of fit test\nWeek 4 Decision making for two samples – Inference on the means of two populations, paired t-test\nWeek 5 Decision making for two samples – Inference on the ratio of variances of two normal populations, inference on two population proportions\nWeek 6 Simple linear regression – Part I\nWeek 7 Simple linear regression – Part II\nWeek 8 Other aspects of simple linear regression\nWeek 9 Midterm exam (In-Class, 1 Cheat Sheet, Calculator)\nWeek 10 Multiple linear regression – Part I\nWeek 11 Multiple linear regression – Part II\nWeek 12 Other aspects of multiple linear regression\nWeek 13 Factorial design, replication, center points – Part I\nWeek 14 Factorial design, replication, center points – Part II \nWeek 15 Blocking, confounding, fractional factorial designs X-bar and R control chart\nWeek 16 Factorial experiments with more than two levels\nWeek 17 Introduction to control charts\nWeek 18 Final exam (In-Class, 1 Cheat sheet, Calculator)","scorePolicy":"1.
