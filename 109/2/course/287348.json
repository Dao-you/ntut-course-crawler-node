The readings include a variety of viewpoints on global topics centered around social issues, the environment, psychology, business, and technology. Extension activities are designed to encourage students to go beyond the reading text, and to put what they acquire from the readings into listening, speaking and writing practices.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction to the course\n\nWeek 2: 6A Amazing Bodies\n             Learning from film dialogue\n\nWeek 3: 6B More Than Human?\n              6C First Responders\n              6D Deep Sea Diving...in a Wheelchair\n\nWeek 4: 7A Money and Me\n             Learning from film dialogue\n\nWeek 5: 7B Waste Not, Want not\n              7C Services in My Town\n              7D Grow Your Own Clothes\n\nWeek 6: 8A Getting Your Message Out\n              Learning from film dialogue\n\nWeek 7: 8B Intercultural Communication\n              8C Ask Me Anything\n              8D 10 Ways to Have a Better Conversation\n\nWeek 8: Film viewing\n\nWeek 9: Midterm exam\n\nWeek 10: 9A Entertain me!\n                Learning from film dialogue\n\nWeek 11: 9B Fast Art, Big Art\n                9C A Bit of Culture\n                9D The World's Most Boring Television\n\nWeek 12: 10A Spend Your Time Wisely \n                Learning from Film dialogue\n\nWeek 13: 10B The Man Who Mastered Time\n                10C Plenty of Time!\n                10D Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator\n\nWeek 14: Discussion of the extra article (to be decided)\n               Learning from film dialogue\n\nWeek 15: Film viewing\n\nWeek 16: Group presentation\n\nWeek 17: Group presentation\n\nWeek 18: Final exam","scorePolicy":"Attendance and participation: 20%\nMid-term exam: 20%\nGroup presentation: 20%\nFInal exam: 20%\nJoint exam: 20%","materials":"Perspectives 2 (National Geographic)","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
