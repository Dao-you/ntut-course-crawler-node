Medical electronics is a broad field that relies on diverse areas of research. Since this is an introductory course, the course will first introduce human anatomy and physiology, and then describes the physics employed in diagnostic techniques, basic electronic elements used in medical applications, basic background for image processing, and later examines aspects of patient safety. Through this course, students will build up a basic knowledge of the electro-medical field, aiming to help the students who are interested in the related fields in the future.","schedule":"3/05　　Basic Anatomy and Physiology\n3/12　　Basic Concepts of Medical Instrumentation I\n3/19　　Basic Concepts of Medical Instrumentation II\n3/26　　Basic Sensors and Principles I\n4/09　　Basic Sensors and Principles II\n4/16　　Microcontrollers in Medical Instrumentation\n4/23　　Student report  I / The Origin of Biopotentais \n4/30　　Biopotential Electrodes\n5/07　　Biopotential Amplifiers\n5/14　　Clinical Laboratory \n5/21　　Medical imaging systems I\n5/28　　Medical imaging systems II\n6/04　　Student Report II /Therapeutic and Prosthetic Devices\n6/11　　Electrical Safety\n6/18　　Final exam \n6/25　　Final Report","scorePolicy":"final report (40%), final exam (30%), class performance (30%)","materials":"1.
