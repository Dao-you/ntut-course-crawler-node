Medical electronics is a broad field that relies on diverse areas of research. Since this is an introductory course, the course will first introduce human anatomy and physiology, and then describes the physics employed in diagnostic techniques, basic electronic elements used in medical applications, basic background for image processing, and later examines aspects of patient safety. Through this course, students will build up a basic knowledge of the electro-medical field, aiming to help the students who are interested in the related fields in the future.","schedule":"2/26　　Brief introduction of the course\n3/05　　Basic Anatomy and Physiology \n3/12　　Physics employed in diagnostics techniques I\n3/19　　Physics employed in diagnostics techniques II\n3/26　　Student report I\n4/09　　Physiological instrumentation\n4/16　　Imaging fundamentals and mathematics \n4/23　　Imaging technology I\n4/30　　Imaging technology II\n5/07　　Student report II\n5/14　　Computing I\n5/21　　Computing II\n5/28　　Biomedical sensors \n6/04　　Medical instruments and devices \n6/11　　Hospital safety\n6/18　　Final exam \n6/25　　Final report","scorePolicy":"final report (40%), final exam (30%), class performance (30%)","materials":"1.
