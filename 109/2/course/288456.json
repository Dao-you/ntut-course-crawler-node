Attention is given primarily to techniques applicable to problems in continuous variables that involve real-valued constraint functions and a single real-valued objective function. \n\nIn short, we will teach not only the concept and applications of engineering optimization; but also how to use it along with ANSYS to develop some very practical models under specific constrains, such as optimal design of a dental implant.","schedule":"1.
