The scientific visualization in this semester focuses on finite element structural analysis data. Students are assumed to be familiar with stress and strain of materials, matrix/vector operations, and are capable of writing programs by using at least one type of programming language.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction to Scientific Visualization and Finite Element Analysis\nWeek 2: Installation of Matlab and OpenSees\nWeek 3: Static stress/strain analysis of 3D framed structures\nWeek 4: 2D/3D coordinate transformation in stress/strain visualization \nWeek 5: Static stress/strain analysis of 3D shelled structures\nWeek 6: Stress/strain visualization of shell elements \nWeek 7: Modal analysis and visualization of 3D framed structures\nWeek 8: Dynamic stress/strain analysis and visualization\nWeek 9: Midterm\nWeek 10: Nonlinear response history analysis and visualization (1)\nWeek 11: Nonlinear response history analysis and visualization (2) \nWeek 12: Integration methods of nonlinear response history analysis \nWeek 13: Nonlinear algorithms of nonlinear response history analysis \nWeek 14: Presentations of proposals for final projects (1)\nWeek 15: Presentations of proposals for final projects (2)\nWeek 16: Advanced topics of scientific visualization (1)\nWeek 17: Advanced topics of scientific visualization (2)\nWeek 18: Final project presentations","scorePolicy":"1.
