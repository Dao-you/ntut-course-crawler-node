Given that business communication across from fields of business activities is now made possible by the English language, the course thus aims to develop the ability to use critical skills essential to successful communication in English, with particular emphases on forms of formal communications that are highly visible within and outside business organizations, including writing of business correspondence and reports, presentations and meetings. Informal communication skills are also incorporated to address workplace situations to identify the relevant communication needs.","schedule":"A detailed course schedule will be distributed on the first day of school.","scorePolicy":"Attendance and participation\nActivities and assignments\nMidterm and final exam\nProjects","materials":"Communicating in Business English.
