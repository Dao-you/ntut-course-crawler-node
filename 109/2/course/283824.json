Analytical chemists use a range of methodologies to separate, identify and determine the relative quantity of components with the aim of establishing the make-up of a chemical substance. We will cover a range of methodologies such as chromatography, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis, all of which are fundamental to the modern analytical chemist.","schedule":"1.

Every week a team need to assign a chapter to the class one week before, lecture it on the class, and give quiz and grade your classmates. For other students, each absence or fail to pass the in-class quiz will deduct 5 points from your final grades.","materials":"Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry, 9th Edition, by Douglas A.
