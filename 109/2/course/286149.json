Nowadays, there are diversity of data type (mostly of non-structured ones) spreading on the air and pipelines, furthermore we are generating much more data and faster than ever before, and the application of big data does impact our daily life. Although we can store and process the data, there are problems using existing techniques to accommodate our most interests. For example, both accessing the data from disk in distributed systems and getting data to the processors are of the typical bottlenecks. \n\nThis course is designed to not only introduce students to Hadoop Big Data application and trend, but also its processing technology and ecosystems which are capable of eliminating the bottlenecks by its unique methods for storing and processing data per common application scenario. In addition, the course provides the platforms for students’ paper reading, group discussion, co-work assignment, case studies and presentation.\n\nThe course will introduce Hadoop core technologies and administration with its major listed below:\n\n　　Big Data in Demand and Its Application Trend\n　　Core Technologies of Hadoop for Big Data Management \n　　Management tool to simplify Hadoop Administration  \n　　Hadoop Cluster Deployment\n　　YARN Applications including MapReduce  \n　　Hadoop Cluster Hardware and Software \n　　Deployment of Hadoop Ecosystem Projects: Sqoop, Flume, Hive and Impala \n　　HDFS Configuration for High Availability\n　　Hadoop Security \n　　Cluster Resource Scheduling and Configuration \n　　Cluster Monitoring and Management\n　　Industrial Big Data and Ecosystems Development and Case Studies","schedule":"(Syllabus, preliminary)\nTuesday. 18:30-21:10\n\nWeek#   Subject to change per needs and circumstances\n \n1      2/23　　        Syllabus &amp; organization of all mission cases from the class\n2      3/02　　        Big Data Application and Trend\n3      3/09             Core Technologies for Big Data Management\n4      3/16　　        Hadoop Cluster Deployment\n5      3/23　　        MapReduce \n6      3/30　　        YARN Applications\n7      4/06             放假一天( Public Holiday)\n8      4/13　　        Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)\n9      4/20　　　　Mid-Exam or Report\n10     4/27　　        Planning Hadoop Cluster Hardware and Software\n11     5/04　　        Hadoop I/O\n12     5/11　　        Hadoop High Available, Failover &amp; Security\n13     5/18　　        Resource &amp; Scheduler Management\n14     5/25　　        Hadoop Ecosystem Project -1\n15     6/01　　        Hadoop Ecosystem Project -2 \n16     6/08　　        Hadoop Ecosystem Project -3 \n17     6/15　　        Case Study and Demonstrations\n18     6/22　　        Final-Exam or Report","scorePolicy":"1.
