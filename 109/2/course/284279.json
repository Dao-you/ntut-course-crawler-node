The theme of this course is to encourage students to participate in the discovery of laws and wonder of nature. And to solidate the foundation for the particular courses of study for different departments. The contents of this course include mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, optics, and foundation of modern physics, etc.. The lecturers will design this course under deliberating the differences of each departments to emphasize or to omit some contents. The course is designed for 6 credits for two semesters; 3 credits for each semester,  and 3 lecture hours per week.","schedule":"Week 1: 庫倫定律\nWeek 2: 電場\nWeek 3: 高斯定律\nWeek 4: 電位\nWeek 5: 電容\nWeek 6: 電流與電阻\nWeek 7: 電路\nWeek 8: 期中考\nWeek 9: 磁場\nWeek 10: 電流造成的磁場\nWeek 11: 電感\nWeek 12: 電磁振盪與交流電\nWeek 13: 馬克斯威爾方程式與磁性物質\nWeek 14: 電磁波\nWeek 15: 影像\nWeek 16: 干涉\nWeek 17: 繞射\nWeek 18: 期末考","scorePolicy":"考試分數：50\n出席點名：30\n反應表現：20","materials":"Text book:\nPrinciples of Physics\u000b, 11/e, Jearl Walker, David Halliday, Robert Resnick\n\n物理教學實驗影片。","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
