Three types of applications are to be covered in this semester-long course: rock slopes, rock foundations, and rock tunnels.  The students are expected to complete assignments in each of the above three categories.  To prepare students with no previous academic work in rock mechanics, this course will review the classification systems of rock masses (such as the RMR and the Q systems).  Also, the stereographic projection is a required tool, which will be introduced in this course.","schedule":"Week 1: Topic 1a. Rock Mechanics &amp; Rock Engineering\nWeek 2: Topic 1b.
