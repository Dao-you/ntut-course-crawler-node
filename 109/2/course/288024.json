The goal of the course is to ensure that graduate students in engineering and management fields are able to interpret, implement, and employ basic regression analysis of several different types of data. The course is primarily devoted to advanced regression analysis. The emphasis is on developing a rigorous calculus and matrix algebra-based understanding of ordinary least squares (OLS), violations of regression assumptions, hypothesis testing, and the general linear model. In addition, the emphasis of this course is on the acquisition and understanding of analytical techniques such as basic concepts of statistics (descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions), simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, log-linear model.","schedule":"Week 1　　Introduction to probability distribution, sampling distribution, and estimation\nWeek 2　　Decision making for a single sample and two samples: Estimation, hypothesis testing, inference on the mean of a population, goodness of fit test – Part I\nWeek 3　　Decision making for a single sample and two samples: Estimation, hypothesis testing, inference on the mean of a population, goodness of fit test – Part II\nWeek 4　　Simple linear regression – Part I\nWeek 5　　Simple linear regression – Part II\nWeek 6　　Simple linear regression – Part III\nWeek 7　　Statistical inference and simple linear regression analysis using R – Part I\nWeek 8　　Statistical inference and simple linear regression analysis using R – Part II\nWeek 9　　Midterm exam\nWeek 10　　Multiple linear regression – Part I\nWeek 11　　Multiple linear regression – Part II\nWeek 12　　Other aspects of multiple linear regression\nWeek 13　　Multiple linear regression analysis using R – Part I\nWeek 14　　Multiple linear regression analysis using R – Part I\nWeek 15　　Polynomial regression analysis\nWeek 16　　Introduction to nonlinear regression analysis\nWeek 17　　Polynomial and nonlinear regression analysis using R\nWeek 18　　Final exam","scorePolicy":"1.
