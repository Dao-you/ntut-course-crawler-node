The students shall learn how these concepts can be applied to model physical effects quantitatively. Particular emphasis is given towards topics relevant to ongoing research in solid state physics .","schedule":"Week 1 (2/22) \nBasic math and physics\n1.Plane geometry\n2.Vector analysis\n3.Eigenvalue and eigenvector\n4.Fouriertransform\n5.Quantum Mechanics\nWeek 2 (3/1)    228 Peaceful Day\nWeek 3 (3/8)    CHAPTER 1: CRYSTAL STRUCTURE.\nWeek 4(3/15)   CHAPTER 2:  DIFFRACTION AND THE RECIPROCAL LATTICE\nWeek 5(3/22)   CHAPTER 4: PHONONS I.
