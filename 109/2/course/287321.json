The readings include a variety of viewpoints on global topics centered around social issues, the environment, psychology, business, and technology. Extension activities are designed to encourage students to go beyond the reading text, and to put what they acquire from the readings into listening, speaking and writing practices.","schedule":"(Week) Date    Content             Activity      \n(1) 2/22           Unit 7                U7A: Vocabulary \n(2) 3/1             (No Class)\n(3) 3/8             Unit 7                U7B: Reading\n(4) 3/15           Unit 7                U7D: TED TALK\n(5) 3/22           Unit 8                U8A: Vocabulary\n(6) 3/29           Unit 8                U8B: Reading\n(7) 4/5              (No Class)\n(8) 4/12           Unit 8                U8D: TED TALK\n(9) 4/19           Midterm exam\n(10) 4/26         Unit 9                U9A: Vocabulary\n(11) 5/3           Unit 9                U9B: Reading\n(12) 5/10         Unit 9                U9D: TED TALK\n(13) 5/17         Unit 10              U10A: Vocabulary\n(14) 5/24         Unit 10              U10B: Reading\n(15) 5/31         Unit 10              U10D: TED TALK\n(16) 6/7                                     Review final exam\n(17) 6/14         (No Class)        \n(18) 6/21         Final exam","scorePolicy":"1.
