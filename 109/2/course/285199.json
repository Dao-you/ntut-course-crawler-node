First, a procedure how to transform a nonlinear system to a T-S fuzzy model is introduced. Secondly, some systematic methods are introduced to design the controllers for the stability of the overall system and the stability condition is formulated by LMIs form. Finally, the design procedure is utilized to demonstrate by a real physical system.","schedule":"Week 1 Introduction \nWeek 2 Modeling methods\nWeek 3 Uncertainties, ij program\nWeek 4 Robust H_infinity problem (Homework #1)\nWeek 5 Time-delay (Delay-Independent, Delay-dependent)\nWeek 6 Input-delay\nWeek 7 Mid-term Report (each one provides a paper report)\nWeek 8 (Mid-term Exam.)\nWeek 9 Non-PDC\nWeek 10 K-means, FCM, FCRM (Homework #2)\nWeek 11 Homework report\nWeek 12 Output feedback\nWeek 13 (Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System) ANFIS\nWeek 14 Relaxed paper 1\nWeek 15 Relaxed paper 2\nWeek 16 Polynomial fuzzy system\nWeek 17 Final report\nWeek 18 Final report","scorePolicy":"1.
