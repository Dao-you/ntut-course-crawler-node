Several learning goals are listed as follows: understanding rate laws and the kinetic parameters, determining kinetic parameters and mechanisms from kinetic data, understanding the effects of catalysts, mass transfer and heat transfer on kinetics. In addition, Students in class will learn about ideal reactor design and kinetic analysis by Matlab and/or COMSOL Multiphysics .","schedule":"W1： Overview of chemical kinetics\nW2-3： Kinetics of homogeneous reaction\nW4-5： Data about A turing to P \nW6-7： Data about A+B turing to P\nW8-9： Multiple reactions\nW10：Temperature and pressure effects \nW11-12：Heterogeneous reaction\nW13-14：Catalytic reaction and adsorption \nW15-16：Solid-fluid reaction\nW17-18：Flow reactor and its design","scorePolicy":"A.\nMidterm Exam 30%\nOral Presentation 30%\nOthers (lectures turned in after class, attendance etc.) 40%\n\nB.\n講義成績  50%\n撰寫MATLAB程式(3~4月)  25%\n使用COMSOL軟體(5月)  20%\n課程相關表現  5%","materials":"Fogler, H.
