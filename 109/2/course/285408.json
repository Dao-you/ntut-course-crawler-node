Besides, they will be taught how to research in the management context. Including lectures, group projects, and presentations, this course elaborates on the major soft and hard Decision Analysis techniques, i.e., Multiple-criteria Decision-making (MCDM) and Optimization, which are of high significance in modern business management. By the end of the course, students should be able to apply a variety of decision analysis tools to analyze and solve real-world decision-making problems.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction to MCDM;\nWeek 2: Structuring unknown decision scenarios using Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory;\nWeek 3: Decision analysis using Quality Function Deployment;\nWeek 4: Optimum Selection using Analytic Hierarchy Process and Analytic Network Process;\nWeek 5: Measuring Attractiveness by a Category-Based Evaluation Technique;\nWeek 6: The concept of Fuzzy set theory and Fuzzy Inference Systems;\nWeek 7: Group decision-making using Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution;\nWeek 8: Peer evaluation using Data Envelopment Analysis;\nWeek 9: Term project - proposal presentation;\nWeek 10: Modeling I;\nWeek 11: Modeling II;\nWeek 12: Simplex method;\nWeek 13: Big M method;\nWeek 14: Dual analysis;\nWeek 15: Final evaluation; \nWeek 16: Term project - final presentation;","scorePolicy":"Presentation and participation in the learning activities (20%)\nFinal evaluation (30%)\nTerm project (50%)","materials":"Gwo-Hshiung Tzeng, and Jih-Jeng Huang.
