The topics it discusses concern some basic questions for we human beings and the world around us. These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death. Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions. The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions, also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.
