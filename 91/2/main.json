the 21th century, there are numerous different thoughts in which some are well recognized, treasured and put in practice. These popular thoughts influence the livelihood, the society and the direction of national development. So contemporary thoughts plays an important role in national development. Such contemporary thoughts and national development are the key contents of this course.The ideal of such thoughts as Racism, Nationalism, and Cosmopolitanism differ from each other, so they have a different effect on national policy decision. Nationalism and Communism influence the political system of the nation and the lifestyle of its citizens. Capitalism, Socialism and Communism have a main impact on the social and economical issues and affect the quality of life of a nation.

It has developed rapidly over the past decade. The reason for the recent advances in structural geology has been the realization that naturally deformed rocks seen in field outcrops contain a fantastic range of small-scale features which relate directly to large-scale orogenic deformation systems. The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course.
