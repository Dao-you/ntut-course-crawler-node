Among the questions we will ask:  How does pop culture differ from traditional or “high” culture normally studied in schools?  What are the standards for evaluating such works?  Should we value pop culture works in the same way as classic works?  Is there a difference between good and bad pop culture:   Can what is popular be good? Must what is popular be good?","schedule":"Week 　　    1: 　　　　Introduction\n　　\n          2-5:　　　　Unit 1　　\n\n          6-8:　　　　Unit 2\n\n            9:　　　　Midterm week\n\n        10-13:　　        Unit 3\n\n        14-17: 　　        Unit 4\n　　\n           18:　　　　Finals week","scorePolicy":"Grades:\n　　Midterm  50%\n　　Final　　50%\n\nAttendance: a combination of 4 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\nWeekly response pages: each missing/late paper  =  -10 points from course grade","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
