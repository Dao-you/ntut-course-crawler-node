In past classes, we have read either a few short stories, a play, or a classic children's novel. Students occasionally make English presentations or participate in skits. Students have opportunities to practice their speaking English and improve their oral and written grammatical skills through speaking and writing activities. Quizzes and tests are given periodically as incentives to learn particular vocabulary and grammar.","scorePolicy":"Homework: 25%\nQuizzes/Tests: 25%\nSkits and Oral Activities: 10%\nPresentations: 10%\nMidterm: 20%\nParticipation: 10%","materials":"American Headway 5\nOnline readings and other materials","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
