The Fuzzy method includes Fuzzy Logic theory and Fuzzy Logic Control.  \nFrom this course, students can understand Fuzzy theory and can apply FLC and Grey in mechanical, electrical, or vehicle systems.  The topics covered in this lecture include: fuzzy set, membership function, fuzzification / defuzzification, fuzzy reasoning and inference, FLC design, FLC applications, grey theory, grey prediction, gray modeling, and grey control (and neural-network if time is available).  This lecture needs all students to do a 2- or 3-person team project to design and implement a fuzzy logic control to a real system.  Before the core lessons, a review of system dynamics will be provided.\n\n課程包含模糊控制與灰色系統，培養學生能運用模糊控制與灰色系統之理論於控制系統及車輛系統上，內容包括模糊集合，近似推理理論，解模糊方法，模糊控制器之設計，模糊控制器之應用，.灰色系統，灰預測原理，灰色建模，灰色控制。","schedule":"week　　course content\n1　　Introduction and Fuzzy logic\n2　　Fuzzy sets / Fuzzy relations term project announce\n3　　LabVIEW programming I\n4　　LabVIEW programming II / Signals and DAQ\n5　　Fuzzy graphs and arithmetic Fuzzy rules\n6　　Fuzzy implications\n7　　Fuzzy approximate reasoning\n8　　Fuzzy logic and probability\n9　　midterm writing Exam　　期中考試\n10　　Fuzzy logic control\n11　　Design of Fuzzy controller\n12　　Design of Fuzzy controller\n13　　Design of Fuzzy controller\n14　　Fuzzy PID control / project I presentation\n15    Fuzzy PID \n16　　self-organizing controller  \n17　　TSK fuzzy control \n18　　project II presentation","scorePolicy":"one midterm writing exam: 35%\nproject and presentation: 50%\nhomework 10%\nclass performance: 5%","materials":"textbook: \nA Course in Fuzzy Systems and Control, by Li-Xin Wang, published by Prentice Hall\n\nreference book: \n1.
