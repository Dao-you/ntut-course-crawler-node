Including High Dynamic Range Photography, Physically Based Rendering, Tone mapping, and Image Based Lighting. Intellectually, this course aims to explore the possibilities of utilizing the related technologies of High Dynamic Range Imaging on design and research applications.\n\n高動態範圍影像為一新興數位影像技術，主旨在於將數位影像能以 RGBE  32 位元格式記錄人類所見光的完整範圍，也因此將數位影像的真實度由相片般相似推進至感知上真實。近年來高動態範圍影像軟硬體技術趨於成熟，高動態範圍顯示器已應用於手機螢幕與家用電視，因此本課程針對此一未來趨勢介紹高動態範圍影像相關技術與理論基礎，包含高動態範圍攝影，物理運算彩現，色調映射，影像光源等數位軟硬體操作。並透過討論引導學生如何在高動態範圍影像技術所建立的數位環境中，發展設計與研究的應用。","schedule":"Week01 HDR &amp; Faithful Picture\nWeek02 HDR Photography\nWeek03 HDR Photography in Design &amp; Research\nWeek04 Tone Mapping\nWeek05 Current Research on Tone Mapping\nWeek06 Physically Based Rendering I\nWeek07 Physically Based Rendering II\nWeek08 Midterm Discussion\nWeek09 Physically Based Rendering III\nWeek10 Image Based Lighting\nWeek11 Material Measuring\nWeek12 Electrical Lighting\nWeek13 Image Mapping\nWeek14 Research Application I\nWeek15 Research Application II\nWeek16 Research Application III\nWeek17 Project Discussion\nWeek18 Final Review","scorePolicy":"Participation   　　20%　　　　\nExercises 　　30%　　　　\nTerm Project　　50%","materials":"Reinhard, E., Heidrich, W., Debevec, P., Pattanaik, S., Ward, G., &amp; Myszkowski, K.
