There will be weekly programming homework!]\n\n The video transmission over the network has occupied more than half of the bandwidth of the internet (by Youtube and services mobile devices for example). Therefore it is essential to compress the video to save the bandwidth and maintain good video quality. This course provides students the general introduction to video compression processes and video transmission in error prone channel. By the end of the course, students will understand the concept of video compression and have a chance to apply their learnt knowledge to improve the video coder.","schedule":"week　　unit\n1. 　　[Course introduction]\n2. 　　Image format, Image quality\n3. 　　Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) \n4.　　Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) \n5.　　Vector quantization and DCT for correlated data compression\n6.　　Codebook design\n7.　　JPEG:DCT, zonal coding, threshold coding\n8.　　JPEG:Zigzag, huffman coding in JPEG\n9.　　[miterm]\n10.　　MPEG(I)\n11. 　　MPEG(II)\n12.　　H.264(I) \n13. 　　H.264(II) \n14. 　　H.264(III) \n15. 　　Multi-View Coding (MVC)\n16. 　　3D image processing\n17. 　　3D image processing\n18. 　　[final]","scorePolicy":"other 30%\nmidterm 30%\nfinal 40%","materials":"[main educational material] Self-written slides\n[reference educational material]\nIain E.
