In films, the off-screen elements usually play much profound roles than the on-screen ones. In the sense, the relation between the visuality and the hidden elements will be examined from scenes to scenes. Also, we will survey some of the philosophical, theoretical, and the critical literatures to further analyze the invisible aspects in the images.\n    During this course we will focus on the subjects of “Time” and “Film sounds”. Since both subjects are invisible and they are the cinematic elements that are significant to this art form. At the end of this course, the auteur films will be discussed. Course requirements include a midterm essay and an oral presentation. By the end of semester, each MA student is required to submit a term paper and each BA student can choose to write a term paper or make a short film by preference.","schedule":"WK 1: 2/22     　　General Introduction.\nIntroduction to media writing.\n(hang-out) from Eugenie Brinkema, “Writing about Media!” [2009]\n\nWK 2: 3/01　　HOLIDAY\n\nWK 3: 3/08　　\nTime and consciousness-1\nReading (R) Sokolowski, R.. 1999. ‘Ch.9 Temporality,’ Introduction to Phenomenology, Cambridge University Press.
