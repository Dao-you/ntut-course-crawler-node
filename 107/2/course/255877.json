An understanding of this process and its different mechanisms requires you to connect principles of thermodynamics and fluid flow with those of heat transfer. A study of this lecture will teach you how to model the concepts of different modes or mechanisms of heat transfer for practical engineering applications.","schedule":"第一週：熱傳簡介 (introduction)\n第二週：熱傳導，熱擴散方程式 (The Heat Diffusion Equation)\n第三週：熱傳導，一維穩態熱傳導 (One-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction)\n第四週：熱傳導，一維穩態熱傳導 (One-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction)\n第五週：熱傳導，熱阻 (Thermal Resistance) \n第六週：熱傳導，延伸表面熱傳 (Heat Transfer from Extended Surfaces)\n第七週：熱傳導，二維穩態熱傳導 (Two-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction)\n第八週：熱傳導，二維穩態熱傳導 (Two-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction)\n第九週：期中考 (Midterm Exam)\n第十週：熱傳導，暫態熱傳導(Transient Conduction)\n第十一週：熱對流，對流邊界層 (The Convection Boundary Layers)\n第十二週：熱對流，外流場與內流場 (External and Internal Flow)\n第十三週：熱對流，自由對流 (Free Convection)\n第十四週：熱對流 ，沸騰與凝結 (Boiling and Condensation)\n第十五週：熱交換器 (Heat Exchanger)\n第十六週：熱交換器 (Heat Exchanger)\n第十七週：熱輻射，史蒂芬波-茲曼定律 (Stefan–Boltzmann Law)\n第十八週：期末考 (Final Exam)","scorePolicy":"作業、小考 40% \n期中考：30%\n期末考 ：30%","materials":"課本：Fundamentals of heat and mass transfer. 7th ed., 2011, Bergman, Theodore L., and Frank P.
