Several learning goals are listed as follows: understanding rate laws and the kinetic parameters, determining kinetic parameters and mechanisms from kinetic data, understanding the effects of catalysts, mass transfer and heat transfer on kinetics. In addition, Students in class will learn about ideal reactor design and analysis.","schedule":"Schedule\nW1： Overview of chemical kinetics\nW2-3： Kinetics of homogeneous reaction\nW4-5： Data about A turing to P \nW6-7： Data about A+B turing to P\nW8-9： Multiple reactions\nW10：Temperature and pressure effects \nW11-12：Heterogeneous reaction\nW13-14：Catalytic reaction and adsorption \nW15-16：Solid-fluid reaction\nW17-18：Flow reactor and its design","scorePolicy":"Grading Scheme\nMidterm Exam 30%\nOral Presentation 30%\nOthers (lectures turned in after class, attendance etc.) 40%","materials":"Textbook\nLevenspiel, O., “Chemical Reaction Engineering,” 3rd ed., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.\n\nReference\nFogler, H.
