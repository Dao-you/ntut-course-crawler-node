Catherine Belsey 回答道：是為了莎翁的獨特性。如她所言：「莎士比亞不僅是英語世界上流社會文化的精華，亦為其整體文化的精髓。」因為莎劇的辭彙，迄今仍通用於英語世界，並已融入日常生活之結構中。這現象不僅發生在現在的英國，自莎翁的時代開始，莎翁的語彙在全世界就從未停止流通過。何況，莎翁震撼人心的詩歌和劇場藝術，無人出其右的人性掌握，以及非凡的人生哲學思維與洞見，向來受到世人的珍愛。如世人常謂：莎士比亞的語言可觸發我們的想像力，為我們在人生的各個層面(包括職業層面)提升溝通效率。為了這些重要的理由，本課程將引導學生欣賞莎士比亞的若干劇作。","en":"Why Shakespeare? Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. As people often observe, Shakespeare may trigger our imagination with his language and promote effective communication in every aspect of our life, including that of our careers. For these important reasons, this course aims to guide students to appreciate Shakespeare by focusing on a number of his plays."},"id":"255784","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"英文四","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=107&sem=2&code=1954","code":"1954"}],"teacher":[{"name":"余盛延","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=2&code=10465","code":"10465"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["5","6","7"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"1080104【停開】","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5404421","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=255784&code=10465"]},{"code":"5701012","name":{"zh":"商業禮儀","en":"Business Etiquette"},"description":{"zh":"由於禮儀存於生活之中，期予學生能充分瞭解商業禮儀，而對其人生有莫大的幫助。〝尊重、肯定、關懷、善解、包容〞是本課程的最高境界。課程內容包括：1.以優雅的儀態展現個人、2.一般社會禮儀、3.辦公室的個人禮儀、4.上班工作禮儀","en":"Because the Etiquette existed in life , hope students can understand Business Etiquette and have much helpfulness to life. \"Esteem 、 certainty、realize、subsume\" is the best constance of this course.

The topics it discusses concern some basic questions for we human beings and the world around us. These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death.

For effective applications of these processing technologies, understanding the principles of chemical kinetics is essential. The major objective of this course is to learn how to design a process for carrying out desirable chemical reaction. To design this process requires rates of both physical and chemical processes. The principles governing such physical processes as energy transfer and mass transfer are often as important as those which govern chemical kinetics. To combine the rates of chemical and physical process, the essential feature is to understand the intrinsic rate of chemical reaction and the transport phenomena of the process. In addition, the basic principles of reactor design will also be introduced based on abovementioned fundamental principles.

Higher wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s electricity generation is higher per amount of capacity installed. In the face of the trend of global greenhouse gas reduction and the realization of the non-nuclear homeland vision, the government has planned a policy goal of renewable energy generation in the proportion of 20% in 2025. In order to achieve this policy goal, the government plans to use solar photovoltaic and offshore wind power as its main force. Among them, offshore wind power was originally planned to reach 3 GW (1 billion watts) in 2025. To assist students to understand the principle and application of thermo-fluid and aerodynamics on offshore wind power, this course is opened for seniors of undergraduate students and graduate students.

Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life.

Higher wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s electricity generation is higher per amount of capacity installed. In the face of the trend of global greenhouse gas reduction and the realization of the non-nuclear homeland vision, the government has planned a policy goal of renewable energy generation in the proportion of 20% in 2025. In order to achieve this policy goal, the government plans to use solar photovoltaic and offshore wind power as its main force. Among them, offshore wind power was originally planned to reach 3 GW (1 billion watts) in 2025. To assist students to understand the principle and application of thermo-fluid and aerodynamics on offshore wind power, this course is opened for seniors of undergraduate students and graduate students.
