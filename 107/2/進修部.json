Are his writings not difficult and more or less inaccessible? Does it not require special training, time and long-term investment to appreciate Shakespeare? Well, the answer might be yes and no. Like it or not, Shakespeare is everywhere in contemporary culture. As Paul Prescott has pointed out, “His presence is not confined to the ‘official’ locations of classrooms, universities and theatres, but permeates popular mass media such as cinema, television, tabloid journalism, computer games, pop music, comics and advertisements.” Indeed, Shakespeare has long been an inescapable icon. His words, characters, and plots have been widely appropriated to appear across a range of popular mass media.
