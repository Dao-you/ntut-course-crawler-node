The topics it discusses concern some basic questions for we human beings and the world around us. These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death.

From putting continually the improved camera, video cassette recorder, copying machine, etc., to market can just account for how important a designing tool the Geometric-Optics is.To build a solid basic theory and a rule for calculating through understanding thoroughly the nature of light is the central goal of Optics. Using the basic theory of optics and processes of approximate estimate, the Geometric-Optics put its point on image formation and its applications.Here in our department, the Geometric-Optics is a 3-credit, 3-hour per week, one-semester course. There are three consecutives parts in the one-semester lecture:The 1st part : (a)the nature of light, (b)the related theorems about reflection and refraction, (c) image formation.The 2nd part : the formation and correctness of aberrations.The 3rd part : the designing of lenses."},"id":"245035","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"▲","class":[{"name":"光電二","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=107&sem=1&code=2196","code":"2196"}],"teacher":[{"name":"吳俊傑","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=11015","code":"11015"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["1","2"],"thu":["2"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教411(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=58","code":"58"}],"people":"53","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"光電二與電資二合開","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=6502006","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=245035&code=11015"]},{"code":"6502012","name":{"zh":"光電工程概論 (一)","en":"Introduction to Optoelectronic Engineering (I)"},"description":{"zh":"本課程為光電科學之概念介紹，本課程包括光的特性、固態物理概念、光的調變、顯示器、雷射、光偵測器、光纖維波導以及光通訊系統。","en":"The course of Introduction to Optoelectronic Engineering introduces the concepts of the science of electro-optics.

The task of decision making entails choosing between various alternatives. This choice is governed by our desire to make the \"best\" decision. The measure of goodness of the alternatives is described by an objective function or performance index. Optimization theory and methods deal with selecting the best alternative in the sense of the given objective function. The purpose of this course is to provide a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods. To accomplish this goal, we include many examples that illustrate the theory and algorithms discussed in the class. However, it is not my intention to provide a cookbook of the most recent numerical techniques for optimization; rather, my goal is to equip the students with sufficient background for further study of advanced topics in optimization."},"id":"245774","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=107&sem=1&code=2323","code":"2323"},{"name":"電資外生所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=107&sem=1&code=2346","code":"2346"}],"teacher":[{"name":"張正春","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=11439","code":"11439"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["6","7","8"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教402(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=52","code":"52"}],"people":"32","peopleWithdraw":"1","ta":[],"language":"英語","notes":"電機所與電資外生所合開","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105092","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=245774&code=11439"]},{"code":"3105128","name":{"zh":"排隊理論","en":"Queueing Theory"},"description":{"zh":"本課程之教學目標在使學生瞭解排隊理論之基本概念及分析方法，並據以分析通訊網路或計算機網路之效能。課程內容包含：(1)排隊理論簡介 (2)相關機率理論 (3)基本排隊模式 (4)各種排隊模式分析 (5)排隊理論應用於各種通訊網路及計算機網路之效能分析。","en":"This course contains the Introduction of Queueing Theory, Related probability theory, Fundamental Queueing models, Queueing models analysis: M/M/1, M/M/c, M/E/1, M/G/1, G/M/1 etc. This course also contains the performance evaluation of communications networks and computer networks based on the queueing theory."},"id":"245784","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=107&sem=1&code=2323","code":"2323"}],"teacher":[{"name":"蔡堆","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=22668","code":"22668"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["7","8","9"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教406(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=54","code":"54"}],"people":"25","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105128","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=245784&code=22668"]},{"code":"3105148","name":{"zh":"高等電腦視覺","en":"Advanced Computer Vision"},"description":{"zh":"電腦視覺簡介及其應用影像形成偵測與配對影像分割以特徵為基礎的定位運動推論結構運動估計影像縫合計算攝影學立體對應三維重建影像辨識","en":"Introduction and Applications of Computer VisionImage FormationDetection and MatchingSegmentationFeature-Based AlignmentStructure from MotionMotion EstimationImage StitchingComputational PhotographyStereo Correspondence3D ReconstructionRecognition"},"id":"245787","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=107&sem=1&code=2323","code":"2323"}],"teacher":[{"name":"黃正民","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=11551","code":"11551"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["5","6","7"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"思源講堂","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=505","code":"505"}],"people":"43","peopleWithdraw":"2","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105148","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=245787&code=11551"]},{"code":"3105171","name":{"zh":"控制系統穩定度分析","en":"Stability Analysis of Control Systems"},"description":{"zh":"1. 數學基礎2.
