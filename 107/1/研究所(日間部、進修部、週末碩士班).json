The task of decision making entails choosing between various alternatives. This choice is governed by our desire to make the \"best\" decision.

Optimization theory and methods deal with selecting the best alternative in the sense of the given objective function. The purpose of this course is to provide a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods. To accomplish this goal, we include many examples that illustrate the theory and algorithms discussed in the class.
