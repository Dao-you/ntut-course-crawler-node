Weekly units are oriented around a progressive series of tasks which consider academic texts in context and require learners to understand, analyse and produce spoken and written texts appropriate to the context of academic English. The contextualisation of these tasks is the philosophical aspects of critical analysis. Themes, such as the difference between convention, fact, opinion and preference; deductive and inductive proof; validity and truth; evidence; and the ethics of persuasion, are the basis on which the skills are taught."},"id":"249741","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"職創新所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=107&sem=1&code=2370","code":"2370"}],"teacher":[{"name":"彭瑞玟","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=10971","code":"10971"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["A","B","C"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"設計207","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=107&sem=1&code=389","code":"389"}],"people":"9","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"設計207；日職合開","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5807059","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=249741&code=10971"]},{"code":"C215020","name":{"zh":"資料探勘技術與產業大數據應用","en":"Data Mining Techniques and Industrial Big Data Applications"},"description":{"zh":"本課程第一階段乃詳述資料探勘技術之原理與應用案例，包含分類、估計、預測、關聯分組、同質分組等範疇。第二階段乃敘述大數據理論、技術、與實務，包含製造業、零售業、服務業等應用實例。","en":"This class will first help students familiarize themselves with the data mining techniques, including classification, estimation, prediction, affinity grouping, clustering, among others.
