These issues are well known by researchers and general public; however, pollutions from construction sites are seldom studied and discussed. Thousand cases of constructions are working monthly, and their potential pollutions can be great impact the environment. The course introduced potential pollution from construction sites and suggested methods to minimize it efficiently.\n\nCourse Goals \nConstruction sites, such as roads and freeways, are important to economic development. During construction, however, such projects pose a significant risk to the environment, which must be addressed out. Compliance with these should minimise the effect of the work on the environment. By the end of the semester, students who complete all necessary assignments will be able to: \n1.　　Understand major concepts and terminology in the field of construction. \n2.　　Evaluate pollution from construction sites and control them.","schedule":"1　　09/11-13      Class syllabus, grading system, text book and references\n2      09/18-20      Pollution &amp; disaster\n3　　09/25-27      Pollution prevention planning\n4      10/02-04　　    Noise &amp; vibration\n5　　10/09-11      Air pollution (1/2)\n6　　10/16-18      Air pollution (2/2) \n7　　10/23-25      Water pollution\n8　　10/30　　     Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (1/2)\n9　　11/06  　　     Mid-term exam\n10　　11/13-15       Soil pollution &amp; land subsidence\n11　　11/20-22       Waste &amp; contaminated materials\n12　　11/27-29       Landscape destruction\n13　　12/04-06       Inspections, monitoring &amp; audits\n14　　12/11-13       Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (2/2)\n15　　12/18-20       Construction automation\n16　　12/25-27       Sustainable construction\n17　　01/03-10       Students’ group reports\n18    01/08　　     Final exam","scorePolicy":"1.
