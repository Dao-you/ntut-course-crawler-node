How and why do consumers make their consumption choices, how do they think and act during the processes, and do they feel satisfied or dissatisfied with their decisions? Various underlying concepts and topics will be discussed (e.g. perception and cognition, human behavior, user experience, ergonomics, human-centered design, policy and social norms, product development, etc.)","schedule":"W01     Course introduction and announcement\nW02     Introduction to consumer behavior (1/2)\nW03     Introduction to consumer behavior (2/2)\nW04     Consumer decision process (1/2)\nW05     Consumer decision process (2/2)\nW06     Exercise session\nW07     Pre-purchase process\nW08     Purchase\nW09     (Mid-term week)\nW10     Post-purchase process\nW11     Individual differences\nW12     Consumer beliefs, feelings, attitudes, and intentions\nW13     Environmental/external influences\nW14     Influencing consumer behavior\nW15     New-/Modern- purchasing platforms\nW16     Final project presentation\nW17     Final project presentation\nW18     (Final exam week)","scorePolicy":"In-class assignment(s) &amp; participation: 30%\nIndividual report or mid-term exam: 30%\nFinal group project: 40%","materials":"Blackwell, R.
