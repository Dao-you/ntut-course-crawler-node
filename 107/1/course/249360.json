Knowing a culture’s stories helps one to understand that culture and to talk with its people.  Sometimes cultures share stories with or about one another.  To help students develop critical thinking skills and the ability to talk about important ideas with people from other cultures, this course examines stories shared across cultures, particularly stories one culture tells about another.  (For example, American stories about Asia or Asian stories about America).","schedule":"　","scorePolicy":"Grades:\n\nMidterm   50%\nFinal   50%\n\n\nAttendance: a combination of 4 absences or late days = -10 points from course grade\n\nWeekly response pages:  each missing/late paper  =  -10 points from course grade","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
