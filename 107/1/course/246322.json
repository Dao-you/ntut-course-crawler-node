The focus of this course will be theory and application oriented and therefore how to use related techniques in handling real world problems based on theory is a must in this course.  Students are required to use relevant data mining techniques in handling real world problems in their final projects.","schedule":"1(09/10)　　Introduction\n2(09/17)　　Illustrated Examples and BI+ Cluster analysis 1\n3(09/24)　　Holiday\n4(10/01)　　Cluster analysis 2\n5(10/08)　　Discriminant 1\n6(10/15)　　Discriminant 2\n7(10/22)　　Discriminant 3\n8(10/29)　　Neural Network (MLP)\n9(11/05)　　Decision Tree\n10(11/12)　　Association Rule\n11 (11/19)  　　Exam\n12 (11/26)　　Text Mining\n13 (12/03)　　Project discussion\n14 (12/10)　　Project discussion\n15 (12/17)　　Project discussion\n16 (12/24)　　Project presentation\n17 (12/31)　　Holiday\n18 (01/07)　　Project presentation","scorePolicy":"Exam            40%\nFinal Project　　60%","materials":"●資料探勘 (Data Mining), 曾憲雄等, 旗標出版股份有限公司, 2005\n●Machine learning, Tom Mitchell, McGraw-Hill, 1997\n●Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, Han and Kamber, Morgan Kaufmann, 2000\n●Predictive Data Mining, Weiss and Indurkhya, Morgan Kaufmann, 1998\n●Data Mining Your Web Site, J.
