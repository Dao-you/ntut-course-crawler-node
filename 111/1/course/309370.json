    "objective": "本課程將閱讀並討論西方重要之現代與後現代詩、小說、及戲劇。在第一次與第二次世界大戰期間，國際藝術運動如達達、未來、和超現實主義者，以及美國作家如費茲爵羅、歐尼爾、賀思騰等人，皆有助於定義西方文學中之現代主義脈動。第二次世界大戰之後，後現代作家如 Beat 詩人和紐約學派運動、劇作家貝克特、和小說作家歐康納、包德溫、和茉莉森接續現代主義而起，卻面對更複雜的美學、藝術、和精神的挑戰，本課程將討論這一系列作家和著作，以及其反映之時代精神。\nThis survey course examines key Modernist and Post-Modern poetry, fiction and drama from the West.  In the period between WWI and WWII, international artistic movements such as the Dadaists, the Futurists and the Surrealists, as well as American writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eugene O'Neill and Zora Neale Hurston helped to define a new Modernist impulse in Western literature; after WWII, post modern writers such as the poets of the Beat and New York School movements, playwright Samuel Beckett, and fiction writers Flannery O'Connor, James Baldwin and Toni Morrison took up where the Modernists had left off, but were faced with still more complex aesthetic, political and spiritual challenges.",
