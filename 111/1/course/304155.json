    "objective": "本課程為總整課程綜合了實際產品 / 服務開發項目中涉及的所學分析、比較和決策關鍵過程。課程提供給學生一個機會來展示對實際產品 / 服務開發的動態、資本要求、策略部署和產品開發交付程序的理解。\n\nThe capstone course synthesizes the learned analytical, comparative, and critical processes involved in real product/service development projects. It provides an opportunity for the student to demonstrate his/her understanding of the dynamics of real product/service development, its capital requirements, strategy deployment, and delivery procedures. \n\nWith the utilization of various real product/service development and design case studies and the input from external industry professionals, this course presents a broad array of design and management contexts, critical decision-making, and business styles. With the intensity of the in-class examination of each case, the student will be required to advance his/her decision-making and management skills to respond to the rapid resolution of real product/service development issues and challenges. With reference to actual development sites and real-time analysis, students will proceed through the assessment of the physical aspects, financial returns, and strategic planning processes of a deal and propose improvements to the outcome.",
    "schedule": "With reference to professional practice, the format for addressing the case studies has three stages\nprogressing from full class discussion, though team-based debate, to the individual presentation:\n1.　　All-class discussion and debate of each of four selected case studies resulting in identification of product/ service development issues, capital structures, strategic planning or decisions which could be improved.\n2.　　Team-based, detailed investigation of each case (every student focuses on one of the four cases studies), resulting in the classroom negotiation between conflicting parties with the objective of improving the outcome, as evaluated by the non-participating class members.\n3.　　Individual exploration for an alternative resolution of the case study examined in the team-based following stage, taking into account the negotiation dynamics of that phase, and producing a comprehensive, detailed, and compelling proposal for an improved outcome. Creative but credible efforts are encouraged, with the deliverable being a soft and hard copy “Business Case Report” for potential capital partners.",
