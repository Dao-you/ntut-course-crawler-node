    "objective": "This course introduces the fundamentals of computer programming. Students will learn the basic components of computer language through exercises during class time. \n\nThe goals of this course is to help students feel confident of their ability to map scientific problems into computational framework, design mathematical algorithms, write and debug programs for specific tasks. We will use Fortran compiler to learn Fortran – the language which has a long relation with scientific computing in Chemical Engineering.\n\nLine 社群 (課程公告): \nhttps://line.me/ti/g2/kq2WPTcDitojTp8D9h-_RCf0iYvj2KOexlDk_A?utm_source=invitation&amp;utm_medium=link_copy&amp;utm_campaign=default\n\n課程 Youtube 頻道 (課程錄影) :\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8heLgO8UqyMUJtJYOOOymEMHDbZsOxSZ\n\nGoogle Meet (上課直播):\nhttps://meet.google.com/dno-kpxx-wjg",
