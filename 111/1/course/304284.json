    "objective": "Web search engine has become one of the necessary tools in modern lives. This course aims at investigating how to index large amount of text documents and search what users need in an effective way. We will introduce the basic concepts of information retrieval, characteristics of documents and languages, various retrieval models, evaluation of retrieval results, indexing and searching, text classification, text clustering, and Web search. In addition to texts, we will also introduce some applications of multimedia retrieval.",
