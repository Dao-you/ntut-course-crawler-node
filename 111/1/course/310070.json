    "objective": "This course is aimed to provide an essential knowledge about the mechanical behavior and design of critical members of a building frame. Main focus will be placed on beam, column, and beam-column joint for their flexure, shear, bond, and anchorage behaviors. Besides, state-of-the-art research about the deteriorated hysteresis behavior and damage evaluation of reinforced concrete columns will be presented.",
    "schedule": "Major Topics include:\n1.　　Design concepts of reinforced concrete members\n2.　　Reinforced concrete material properties and quality controls\n3.　　Mechanical behavior of reinforced concrete\n4.　　Confined concrete models and axial compression tests\n5.　　Fundamentals of beam flexure\n6.　　Moment curvature analysis and software demonstration\n7.　　Concentrated plasticity approach for deflection calculations\n8.　　Shear transfer mechanism and shear design\n9.　　Bond and anchorage design\n10.　　Cross-sectional analysis of columns and biaxial bending\n11.　　Seismic response of structures\n12.　　Seismic design and consideration of building frames\n13.　　Behavior and design of beam-column joints\n14.　　Cyclic behavior and analytical methods for RC columns\n15.　　Deteriorated hysteresis behavior of RC columns\n16.　　Damage evaluation of RC columns",
