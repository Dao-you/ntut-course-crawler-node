    "objective": "This course aims to help students enhance their comprehension and reading ability of literary works, with the expectation to provide students a better understanding of western literary works as well as to explore students’ interest in literature.\nIt will be a reading-based course, and in addition to the cultivation of mind, students will be expected to improve vocabulary as well. The instructor intends to center on sixteen writers this semester, with the foci on the relationships between the genders in the first eight weeks, and human nature after the midterm exam. Through oral presentations and class discussion, students will have a broader view of how literature is on some level a reflection of “human” life and have the capability to interpret literary works.",
