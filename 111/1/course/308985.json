    "objective": "Design methodologies can evolve with the emergence of advanced technologies. This course will introduce a historical account of design methodologies from Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA) to Design for X (DFX). In this regard, additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has great potential for creating products with complex geometric, particularly for custom-fit ergonomic devices. Project-based activities will be carried out for students to explore the effects of good and bad designs for 3D printing.\nUpon completing this course, you will be able to:\n1.Describe the evolution of design methodologies \n2.Discuss the differences between an artist, a designer, and an engineer   \n3.Identify the key advantages and process-specific constraints of AM technology\n4.Breakdown the 3D workflow from art to part  \n5.Use computational design tools to optimal application requirements for 3D parts",
