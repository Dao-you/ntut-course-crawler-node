    "objective": "The ECA courses are designed for the first-year (freshman), non-native English speaking students to strengthen their English language skills, with particular emphasis on communicative competence and practical application in social, cultural and professional contexts. By integrating the four skills (reading, listening, speaking and writing), the primary objective is to connect the classroom ELT with the real-life communicative situations. The course will be focusing on reading strategies, communication skills and vocabulary building. Class activities include class discussion, group discussion, presentation and so on. Students are required to express their thoughts in English during the class.",
