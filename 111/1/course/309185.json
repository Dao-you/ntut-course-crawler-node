    "objective": "Modern control theory mainly focuses on linear system analysis and design.  This is the course where students from a variety of backgrounds begin to acquire the mathematical tools used in research literature involving linear systems.  The core material covered in this course is the theory of time-varying linear systems, in both continuous-time and discrete-time, with frequent specialization to the time invariant case.",
