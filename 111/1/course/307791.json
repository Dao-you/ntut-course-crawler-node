    "objective": "The objective of this course is to introduce students to core ideas of probability and statistics, and also to provide an understanding on statistical concepts to include measurements of location and dispersion, probability, probability distributions, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and simple and multiple linear regression. Consequently, these skills will provide the student with a basis to conduct their own such analyzes and to evaluate critically others’ uses of statistics.",
