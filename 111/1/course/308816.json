    "objective": "Two major goals of this course are spectroscopy and separation methods. Spectroscopy methods include ultraviolet, visible, infrared, nuclear magnetic, and x-ray spectroscopies.Election and mass spectrometry are also included. Separation methods are: gas, liquid, and gel chromatographies. In addition, GC-MS,LC-MS, GC-IR, etc. will be studied.",
