    "objective": "The purpose of this course is talking about how to utilize scientific and systematical approaches to solve management problems. The solution process includes data collection and problem investigation, model formulation, optimal solution derivation, cost and efficiency analysis, system implementation and execution etc. This course mainly contains various application cases. Accordingly, participant can understand how to apply theoretical methods on solving real problems. Computational software is also utilized to solve the formulated models and analyze and interpret the obtained solutions.",
