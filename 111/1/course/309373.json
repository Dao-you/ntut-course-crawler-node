    "objective": "In literary studies, when we encounter the term \"legend\", it is often understood as stories that center on human protagonists rather than supernatural beings - as differentiated from \"myth\" - such as the stories of King Arthur and his knights, the search for the Holy Grail, and the dragon-slaying in medieval literature. This course, however, will not be limited by the scope of the Middle Age and will extend the definition of \"legend\" by examining the prominent archetypes in Western literature. The course will explore how these archetypes not only form the basis of classic literature, but also pervade and enrich our popular culture including films, anime, and video games.",
