    "objective": "It's an EMI (English as a medium of instruction) course. \n\"Microsoft Teams\" will be used as the software for the distance teaching once the Level 3 alert announced. Microsoft has authorized Taipei Tech staffs and students to use TEAMS. Please register this software following the Taipei Tech instruction.\n\nThis course focuses on the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials, including gas-phase and solution-phase reactions. The core contents of the course are:\n(1) Various solution-phase synthesis of nanopowders, hollow nanospheres and nanowires\n(2) Synthesis of nanotubes and nanowires by gas-phase reaction\n(3) Nano-Imprint Lithography\n(4) Nanomaterials analysis technology",
