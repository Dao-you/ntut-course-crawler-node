    "objective": "In this course, we will systematically introduce various analysis techniques including UV-vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometer, thermal analyses, optical microscopy, electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Students who study this course can establish a theoretical framework for the analysis of various organic materials, which will help their future research and employment development.",
