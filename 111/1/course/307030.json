    "objective": "Optical mechanical systems have changed the world and they will continue to do so. The course of optical machinery designed practice aims to be a solution provider for high-end customers in astronomy, aerospace, military, accelerator, and medicine. Also the knowledge can satisfy mass production industries of mobile, automobile, and machine vision. To meet that need, not only does the course introduce core knowledge in optics and mechanics but also practice modeling and case studies to enhance the capability of problem solving and innovation. The subject makes possible to initiating students’ interest in the optical mechanical industry so as to make it as their future careers.",
    "schedule": "According to Syllabus, 1-4 weeks: bask knowledge. 4 weeks for modelging, 8 weeks for practice and the rest of 2 weeks for oral presentation and report.",
    "scorePolicy": "class attendance (40%). question asking (10%). report (20%) and oral presentation(30%) for final.",
