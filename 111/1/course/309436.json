    "objective": "This course briefly introduces the physical principles behind the instruments commonly used in hospitals and their integrated applications. To allow students to prepare enough background knowledge for entering the field of medical materials in the future, and to further extend the optoelectronic capabilities that students in this department have learned to the application of biomedical optoelectronics for cross-field learning. The content mentions the principles of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, endoscopy, etc.",
