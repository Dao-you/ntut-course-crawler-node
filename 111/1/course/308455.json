    "objective": "本課程之目的在於使學生瞭解化學反應工程之原理以及訓練學生能夠應用此些原理於設計，分析或操作化學反應器。此課程首先複習大學部已學習在均相中動力學之基礎理論，再推廣至非均相較複雜之系統。\n\nIn this course, a structure is developed that allows the student to solve reaction engineering problems through reasoning rather than through memorization and recall of numerous equations, restrictions and conditions under which each equation applies. A special emphasis on bioreaction engineering and more industrial chemistry with real reactors and real reactions will be covered and wide range of applications to which chemical reaction engineering principles will be applied.",
