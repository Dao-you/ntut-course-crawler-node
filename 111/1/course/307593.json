    "objective": "Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are popular transmission techniques for wireless and mobile communications, because they offer several advantages such as increasing transmission data rate and enhancing error performance. In the class, we will learn about the basic principles and some advanced topics of OFDM and MIMO. We will also learn how to write a MATLAB program to evaluate the performance of a communication system. All students taking this class have to study a special topic on OFDM or MIMO as a final project.",
