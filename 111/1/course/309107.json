    "objective": "＊提醒：本課程為全英語授課，對學生英語程度要求高，需要經常以英語回答問題，口頭報告並與外籍生互動，期末考也需以全英語作答。 無法達成上述要求可導致無法順利通過本科目。\n\n＊Reminder: This is an international students friendly course. Domestic students are required to use full English to answer questions, do the presentation and write exam sheets.\n\nThe properties of materials in service will be discussed in detail.  Special focus will be on the theoretically discussion of the behavior of materials.  Topics covered include plastic deformation、strengthening mechanisms、fracture、creep and fatigue、heat capacity、thermal expansion、thermal conductivity、the law of electrolysis、electrolytic conductance and transport, and ionic activity、reversible electrode potentials、Irreversible electrode processes、electrochemical measurements、kinetics of phase transformation、diffusion、kirkendall effect、thermodynamic properties of alloy systems、thermodynamics of surfaces and interfaces",
