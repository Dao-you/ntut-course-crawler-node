    "objective": "The subject is designed to include two professional realms – random vibration and time-frequency domain analysis. The fundamentals of random vibration include statistics, correlation analysis, spectrum estimation, spectral analysis of the SDF system, and so on. The time-frequency domain analysis includes the FFT technique, Hilbert Transform, short-time Fourier Transform, and Wavelet analysis, and so on.",
