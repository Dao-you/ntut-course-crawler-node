    "objective": "本課程介紹科學和工程數值分析的理論，應用，和程式編撰，包括初步誤差分析、方程式求解、逼近法、微分方程、線性代數、線性和非線性回歸，與離散傅利葉變換。本課程著重於使用目前廣泛採用的數值分析開發環境與程式語言，並透過動手練習讓學生體驗數值分析技術在人工智能中的應用。 本課程學生應至少已完成微積分第一年的學生而設計。\nThis course introduces the theory, applications, and programming implementation of numerical analysis for science and engineering, including preliminary error analysis, solutions of equations, approximation, differential equations, linear algebra, linear and nonlinear regression, and discrete Fourier transform. Programming implementation is also intensed in the lectures using a current popular development environment for numerical analysis. The application of numerical analysis techniques on artificial intelligence is also introduced with hands-on exercises. This course is designed for engineering majors who have completed at least the first year of the calculus sequence.",
