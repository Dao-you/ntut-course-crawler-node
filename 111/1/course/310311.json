    "objective": "This course will focus on the design research methods of innovative products and mixed reality. It is expected that through the core concepts of virtual-real integration and user experience, it will apply research methods to deeply explore design problems and pain points in user experience and explore physical product design and virtual reality. We will integrate various possibilities of service design with innovative concepts. Then, we intend to utilize the implemented innovative concept by design methods, software, and hardware technologies to achieve the design services and experiences that meet and satisfy users in future life.",
