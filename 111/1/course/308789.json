    "objective": "This course aims to teach students the fundamental knowledge of glass materials. It will start with the principle of glass formation from thermodynamics and kinetics perspectives. Then the structure of several widely used glass systems will be introduced. Afterward, important properties of glass, including mechanical, dynamical, optical, electrical properties, and chemical durability will be discussed.",
