    "objective": "先修課程：普通物理、工程數學。 從黑體輻射之頻譜分析開始，引入量子化的概念；進而推出物質與波動之二象性。經由波爾之半古典的氫原子模型，結合量子化的概念以解釋原子結構，並引入薛丁格方程式所求得之波函數與電子之空間機率的關係。再由原子進而推廣至分子及固態物理之能帶理論，應用能帶理論於解釋固態晶體之光、電及熱學等特性，並介紹半導體之應用的基本原理。\nFrom the analysis of the spectrum of black-body radiation, the concept of quantization is introduced and the duality of matter and wave is also introduced. Combining the idea of quantization and the semi-classical hydrogen model of Bohr, the structure of atom is described. Solving the Schrodinger equation, the deduced wave function is related to the probability of finding the electron in space. The concept of atom is expanded to the molecular and the energy band theory of solid state physics. The energy band theory of solid state physics is applied to account the optical, electrical, and thermal properties of solid states, also the fundamental principles of semiconductors are introduced.",
