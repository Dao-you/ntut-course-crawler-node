    "objective": "This course aims at providing a learning opportunity to use MATLAB programs to solve statistical analysis problems. MATLAB is one of the common mathematic analysis software and a very popular language in data mining. Its multidisciplinary platform function and built-in orders for statistic calculation and drawings can literally be powerful for statistics learning. In this semester, the schedule includes basic MATLAB practices, engineering statistics, associate practice examples, problems involving extreme value analysis, and problems involving reliability analysis.\nThe goal of this course is to teach students how to use the open source software R for statistical analysis. R is currently the most commonly used free, open source, and cross-platform statistical software. It has many statistical functions, graphing tools, and its own programming language. Because of its many potential applications, the familiarity of this software could help students in the pursue of their chosen career paths, whether in industries or academic researches. This course will cover the various aspect of R, including installation, operation, data analysis, and program development. An entry-level statistical course is required before taking this course.",
