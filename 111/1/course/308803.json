    "objective": "This course provides the fundamental theories and architectures for baseband wireless communications. It is concerned that how reliable communication can be achieved and what is the diversity a channel can provide. Much attention will be focused on the newly developed technology, called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission.\nCourse outline:\nPart 1. Fundamental Matrix Operations.\nPart 2. Wireless Channels and Single-Antenna Wireless Communications.\nPart 3. MIMO Wireless Communications.",
