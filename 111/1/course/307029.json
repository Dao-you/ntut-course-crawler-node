    "objective": "The class is to introduce some basic knowledge about optical design systems such as the matrix formalism of geometrical optics and aberrations. Moreover, this class is to provide the students with experience in modeling the theory and applications for optical system design, using commonly used software tools such as MATLAB and COMSOL. Student will also learn more system design such as the solar dish receiver and laser system from professional specialist faculties from Pitotech.",
