    "objective": "The course covers fundamental concepts of chemical kinetics in batch reactors or ideal flow reactors. Several learning goals are listed as follows: understanding rate laws and the kinetic parameters, determining kinetic parameters and mechanisms from kinetic data, understanding the effects of catalysts, mass transfer and heat transfer on kinetics. In addition, Students in class will learn about ideal reactor design and kinetic analysis by Matlab or Polymath and COMSOL Multiphysics .\n* 課程討論化學動力學知識，應用程式 (Matlab or Polymath and COMSOL Multiphysics) 解題。",
    "schedule": "W1： Overview of chemical kinetics\nW2-3： Kinetics of homogeneous reaction\nW4-5： Data about converting from A into P \nW6-7： Data about converting from A+B into P\nW8-9： Multiple reactions\nW10：Temperature and pressure effects \nW11-12：Heterogeneous reaction\nW13-14：Catalytic reaction and adsorption \nW15-16：Solid-fluid reaction\nW17-18：Flow reactor and its design\n\nBring your own laptop to join this class (no need to use it in the first class).\n本課程需自備筆記型電腦 (第一堂不需要使用)。",
