    "objective": "The objective of the course is to learn how digital image practices in real-world applications, especially in medical images and computer vision.\nThis class will introduce the image's composition, image adjustment, design, and even feature extraction for radiomics to apply to image detection and recognition. We will train some popular image processing algorithms about image processing and implement them in medical imaging projects.",
