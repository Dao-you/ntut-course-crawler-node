    "objective": "This course is aimed at equipping students with fundamental knowledge about structural analysis for beams, frames, and trusses. This semester will focus on analysis of statically determinate structures about their reactive forces, internal loadings, deflections, and influence lines. Energy methods for determining the structural deflections will also be presented in the course.",
