Only then can it live up to the name of the university's Chinese language curriculum and conform to the school's fine tradition of emphasizing practical application.\n\nDepending on the choice of the instructor, the courses can be divided into two categories.\n1. Literature: Focus on the deepening of literary taste, language sensitivity, literary creativity and practical creativity.\n2.
