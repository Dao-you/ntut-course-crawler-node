And then apply it to the design of tools, facilities, systems, works and environments in order to enhance the quality of life and productivity. This course includes research and scientific approaches, physical design, human beings' sensory process and information process, human/machine interface, operating environments, and safety.\nThe aim of this course is to inspire students for human factors science through evidence-based approaches in improving products and systems by considering human capabilities and needs \u000b(also socio-technical factors) when interacting with products & systems. In this course we step from theory to practical implementation.",
