    "objective": "國際能源署 (IEA) 呼籲全球國家訂定淨零碳排路徑，國內也啟動淨零目標期程與行動方案，針對建築部門，建築能效評估系統 (Building energy efficiency rating system, TBERS) 為因應亞熱帶氣候與空間複合化、多樣化建築特性所量身訂做的簡易有效評估工具。為使學生培養永續淨零概念並具備建築能效評估計算、評分與標示之技術能力，具體目標如下:。\n1. 了解國內外淨零碳排路徑策略\n2. 評估新建建築、既有建築能效等級\n3. 操作新建建築、既有建築之近零設計策略\n4. 綜合分析與歸納建築能效機制\nIEA (The International Energy Agency) proposes to set a global net carbon emission roadmap, and domestically launch a net target and action plan, targeting the building sector, the Building Energy Efficiency Rating System (TBERS) a simple and effective assessment tool tailored for subtropical climate and spatial complex and diverse building characteristics. This course aims at develop the concept of sustainable net zero and have the technical ability of building energy efficiency assessment calculation, scoring and marking, the specific goals are as follows:\n1. Understand domestic and foreign net zero carbon emission path strategies\n2. Evaluate the energy efficiency rating of new buildings and existing buildings\n3. Operate the nearly-zero design strategy of new buildings and existing buildings\n4. Conclude the analysis and induction of building energy efficiency mechanism",
