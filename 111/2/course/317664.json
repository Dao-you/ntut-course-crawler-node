    "objective": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of class and objects. With properties and methods that can describe the features of classes, a programmer can model the real world objects in an systematical way. In addition, the three important mechanisms of OOP, which are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, also enable a programmer to reuse and share their code easily and efficiently. \n\nBase on the Architecture/Engineering/Construction applications, this course aims to train the enrolled student for developing the basic OOP concepts, analyzing the database schemas, as well as implementing the OOP skills on information systems developments.",
