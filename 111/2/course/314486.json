    "objective": "Course Description: This course is designed to provide graduate students an advanced materials synthesis, understand different synthetic technique and analytical application to promote success in their graduate carriers. Core concepts will be presented by both students and course instructor via presentations, discussions and with real time experiments. The curriculum will be wide in scope incorporating aspects of trouble shooting, experimental result discussion, chemical measurements, modern analytical instrumentation, and determination of chemical structure via analytical techniques. Special emphasis will be put on the appropriate preparation, and meaningful presentation, of scientific results. The student is expected to dedicate significant effort both in and out of lectures to be successful.\n\nObjectives:\nSpecific goals for the course include the student learning:\n1) To understanding the innovative materials for wider application\n2) To improve the synthetic technique to find attractive materials\n3) To discuss properties and mechanism of the innovated materials\n4) To apply the advanced materials for current scientific challenges\nTexts and Materials: Available in lab, you can read at any time in lab",
