    "objective": "This course will talk about basic mathematical analysis of complex numbers, together with possible applications. Students interested in mathematics of complex analysis are welcome to take this course. Particularly, having acquired the knowledge of calculus, engineering mathematics, or differential equations will make the learning process much easier.\nAlthough the lectures will be given in English, Chinese speaking students are also encouraged to take this course. The lecturer believes that English should not be an issue stopping students from taking this course and will endeavor to reduce the language barrier. If necessary, explanations in Manderine may be provided to assist teaching complicated concepts and to facilitate learning.\nTo elucidate abstract or abstruse ideas more vividly, the lecturer may also use MATLAB for demonstration. Hopefully, through a semester of learning, students can become more confident of and more familiar with addressing complex analysis.",
