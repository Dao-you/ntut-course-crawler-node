    "objective": "本課程著重教導學生閱讀文章，並藉由文章訓練學生字彙建構、語言解析及聽力會話、思維啟發能力。課中延展活動將閱讀內容與聽力、會話、寫作做進一步的連結，並引導學生將所學做有效的應用。\nThe course provides students with explicit skills-based instruction in learning how to process, and decipher the readings that serve as springboards for reading skills development, vocabulary building, language analysis, and thought-provoking discussions. The readings include a variety of viewpoints on global topics centered around social issues, the environment, psychology, business, and technology. Extension activities are designed to encourage students to go beyond the reading text, and to put what they acquire from the readings into listening, speaking and writing practices.",
