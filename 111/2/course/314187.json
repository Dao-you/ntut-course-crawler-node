    "objective": "Data is everywhere. As the physical and digital worlds have become intertwined, more and more design decisions are expected to be supported by data analytics. Hence, this course aims to build your data literacy skills as a designer. The course will begin by introducing the need for personalized products and services to create a better user experience. This concerns not only the cognitive but also affective aspects. The insights obtained from the data can then be translated to determine product/service/system requirements. Students will spend the majority of the class time on research-oriented projects.\nUpon completing this course, you will be able to:\n1. Distinguish the difference between mass production and personalization \n2. Gain a better understanding of how data science can be incorporated into the design process \n3. Describe the characteristics and forms of data generated by different sources such as humans, machines, or environments \n4. Apply suitable tools/software to interpreT small- or large-scale dataset\n5. Understand the key principles in the ethical use of data in the design process",
