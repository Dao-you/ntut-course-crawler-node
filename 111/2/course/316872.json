    "objective": "Granular material flows are commonly occurred in many industrial applications and nature hazards, such as fluidized bed, additive manufacturing, and debris avalanche. To provide a comprehensive understanding for granular materials flows, this course will be divided into three parts. We start from the basic flow characteristics of granular materials and its rheological models. Then, we will move to the simulation approaches for granular material flows in view of continuum and discrete description. Finally, the two-phase suspension system will be introduced, followed by the demonstration of practical industrial and geophysical applications for these complex flows.",
