    "objective": "This course aims to introduce students to key theoretical and methodological approaches in urban design. The main content will be delivered through a series of case study discussion and project-based research practice. In specific, the case study is to review and identify key factors shaping the physical environment of cities; while through independent research projects, students are expected to engage in a step-by-step process of on-site observation and computational analysis, examining how the factors are interacting with each other.\n\nNote: Competency in the basic use of computer is required. In class, the instructor will provide tutorials about how to use the computational analysis tool (Space Syntax).\n\nOffice Hour: Tuesday 16:00-17:00",
