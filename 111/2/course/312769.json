    "objective": "本課程幫助學生習得敘述、描寫、推論、議論、省思、說明等文體方面的寫作技巧，並指導學生從閱讀、圖片、日常生活事件，及課堂討論內容中取材，以加強邏輯思考和流暢寫作能力。\nThis course aims to develop and reinforce students' strengths to create unified and coherent pieces of composition in a variety of styles--narrative, descriptive,  argumentative, reflective, and expository.  Students will be guided to write in response to readings, pictures, events in their daily lives, and discussions from the class.  Thought-provoking topics dealing with current issues are used to stimulate and foster critical writing strategies. This course enables students to write and discuss logically and clearly; they also need to incorporate grammatically newly-built vocabulary into their writing.",

This semester, we will work on resumes and cover letters as well as continuing with analysis skills (one literary analysis with secondary sources). Students will also engage in a group project to write their own periodical.",
