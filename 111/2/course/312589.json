    "objective": "Develop an understanding of fluid dynamics in aerospace engineering as well as a variety of other fields. Learn to use control volume analysis to develop basic equations and to solve problems. Understand and use differential equations to determine pressure and velocity variations in internal and external flows. Understand the concept of viscosity and where viscosity is important in real flows. Learn to use equations in combination with experimental data to determine losses in flow systems. Learn to use dimensional analysis to design physical or numerical experiments and to apply dynamic similarity.",
