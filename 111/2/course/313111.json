    "objective": "This course is intended to deliver a fundamental knowledge about the principles of mechanics based on which most of the professional and advanced courses in civil engineering were developed. Main topics will include vectors and scalars, motion in one and two dimensions, the Newton’s laws of motion, work and energy, conservation of energy, linear and angular momentum, oscillatory motion, mechanical waves, fluid mechanics, temperature and the kinetic theory of gases, the laws of thermodynamics, etc.",
    "schedule": "Major Topics include:\n1.\tConservation of energy\n2.\tMomentum and collisions\n3.\tRotational motion\n4.\tOscillatory motion\n5.\tMechanical waves\n6.\tFluid mechanics\n7.\tTemperature and the kinetic theory of gases\n8.\tThe laws of thermodynamics",
