    "objective": "PLEASE NOTE THAT THE WORKING LANGUAGES OF THIS INTERPRETING TRAINING COURSE ARE ENGLISH AND CHINESE.\n\n本課程延續「中英口譯入門」之內容，學生演練雙向語言之積極聆聽、重述、記憶保留、摘要及逐步口譯筆記，強化之前習得之技巧。擴大譯出語演說之議題深度與廣度，口譯片段加長，學生能持續加強分析與歸納綜合訊息的能力。學生進一步認識基礎專業同步口譯，回溯之前習得的口譯技巧，熟悉同步口譯的基本要素，包括重述、專注力分割、一心多用、聽譯時間差、預測及重組等。\nBased on Introduction to Chinese-English Interpreting, students continue with practical exercises aimed at reinforcing skills in active listening, recall and memory retention, gist extraction and note-taking in both directions. Increasing lengths and difficulties of speeches of diverse topics also enables students to strengthen and apply more advanced analytical and synthetic skills. Students continue to brush up on skills obtained previously and learn essential SI strategies, including paraphrasing or re-oralizing, split attention, multitasking, the time lag between interpreter and speaker, anticipation and reformulation.",
