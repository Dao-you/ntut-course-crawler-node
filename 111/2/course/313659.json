    "objective": "This course introduces the theory and characteristics of network and integer programming problems. In network models, basic graph theory along with network optimization algorithms is included to have a comprehensive understanding in real-world applications. Introduction to integer programming problems includes traveling salesman problems as well as detail study of valid inequalities and branch-and-bound method, along with the concepts, techniques, mathematical analysis and justification. Emphasis is placed on the modeling and the use of commercial software.",
