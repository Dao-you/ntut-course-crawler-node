    "objective": "每天在工作和空閒時間，我們都需要運用邏輯和批判性思維來提出有說服力的論點。 我們爭論如何增加銷量，爭論政府通過的法律是否公平，爭論什麼是最好的電影。 本課程檢查邏輯和理性論證所需的條件。 學生學習如何識別他人提出的好的（和壞的）論點，以及如何構建和組織自己的邏輯論點。 該課程幫助學生在一系列實用學科中練習批判性思維技能，包括新聞、政治、科學、倫理、藝術和娛樂。Everyday at work and in our free time we need to use logic and think critically in order to make persuasive arguments.   We argue about how to increase sales, about the fairness or unfairness of laws passed by the government, and about what the best movie is.  This course examines what is required for a logical and rational argument.  Students study how to identify good (and bad) arguments made by other people and how to structure and organize logical arguments of their own.  The class helps students to practice their critical thinking skills across a range of practical subjects, including the news, politics, science, ethics, art and entertainment.",
