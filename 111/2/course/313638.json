    "objective": "本課程主要目的在於教導學生如何利用時間序列分析、品質製程管制、工程製程控制等方法來達成先進製程控制的目的。課程講述之內容包含下列課題：製程監控、製程調整、離散動態製程、時間序列模型、轉換方程模型、最佳回饋控制器、指數加權移動平均控制、遞迴式估計與自適應控制等。\nThe purpose of this course is to provide students a modern treatment of discrete-time advanced process control (APC) methods based on time series analysis, statistical process control (SPC) and engineering process control (EPC) for Quality Engineering in manufacturing. From an engineering perspective, process control is gaining recognition in the semiconductor industry as a means to compensate for equipment changes due to inconsistent operation, process drifts and process shifts. So, practical and theoretical components that comprise the foundation for the APC will be addressed as well.",
