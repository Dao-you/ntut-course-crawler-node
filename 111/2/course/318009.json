    "objective": "The course aims to implement problem-based learning for the design of modern optical devices. Practical case studies in the design of optical components and systems will help students become an optical consultant who has the ability to solve problems, especially for wave optics.\nStudents will learn commercial optical software, which are commonly used in the industry, to simulate the assigned cases studies for modern optics including optical communication, photosensitive materials, and nano-optical structures.\nFinally, students are required to autonomy to design, plan, execute, analyze and implement their research ideas to others. There are two ways to presenting their final research results: poster presentations or oral presentations.",
    "schedule": "Opening week: introduction to the modern optics \nFirst: Industrial case studies for metalens applications \nSecond : literal review and survey \nThird: Case study via simulation tools \nFourth: simulation result and discussion\nSix: Final oral presentation",
