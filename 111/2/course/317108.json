    "objective": "Students will learn how to write and present using professional English, with particular focus on design and cultural vocations majors. This semester, we will work on punctuation and spacing, in addition to other grammar and vocabulary. Students will also design an Alice-in-your-major project. \n\nOfficial description: The course provides students with explicit skills-based instruction in learning how to process, and decipher the readings that serve as springboards for reading skills development, vocabulary building, language analysis, and thought-provoking discussions. Extension activities are designed to encourage students to go beyond the reading text, and to put what they acquire from the readings into listening, speaking and writing practices.",
    "schedule": "We will be working through chapters 7–12 of American Headway, which I find to be a very engaging book that also clearly explains a lot of the grammatical intricacies that often trip up non-native speakers. It is no problem if you have not taken the first half of the course (so long as you can get a copy of the textbook) as the topics taught are not cumulative. We will also read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and do an Alice-in-your-major project.",

The book is usually also available at Taipei Tech's temporary bookstore. \n\n2) Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Students usually enjoy reading this classic! It's a great way to improve your vocabulary, logic, understanding of the English language, and cultural knowledge (as well as your understanding of English jokes and puns.)",
