For this, the concepts and the analysis technique of electric circuit are learned , in which the related electromagnetic theory, physical concepts and mathematic methods for solving the circuit problems will be enhanced . The approach methods including the analytical methods and numerical methods are studied. From which, the students can realize many circuit theorems and their applications and some associated approach software. In addition to the circuit analysis techniques, the students are encouraged to solve some simple circuit synthesis problems for futher study on the circuit design and its related fields in the future.\n主要教材為:\n教科書名 Electric Circuits (Seventh Edition)\n作者 James W.
