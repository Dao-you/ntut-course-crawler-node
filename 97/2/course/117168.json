Several programming and software will be introduced.  Students will practice and define their own optimization problems.  Through the homework, project exercises, project discussion, and presentation, student will be able to utilize the optimization on their own research topics.  And that’s the goal of this course -- to make optimization be part of daily life and study.\nThe course will cover ”Optimum Design Problem Formulation”, ”Graphical Optimization”, ”Optimum Design Concepts”, ”Linear Programing”, ”Numerical Methods” &amp; ”Practical Design Optimization”","schedule":"a.
