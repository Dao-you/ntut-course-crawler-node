The cultural literacy movement in the United States was in part an effort to define that set of basic cultural information which would enable students to better understand what they read, whether in school or in newspapers (since such basic knowledge is often assumed by writers to shared by their readers).  This course will consider what it means to be a “literate” observer of literature, what essential elements constitute the grammar, as it were, of literary study. This, however, is not to consider merely basic encyclopedic knowledge of trivia (Who wrote Hamlet?), but to ask what the significance of that work is to the culture (Why do people still read Hamlet?)  In an attempt to become better acquainted with the principle texts and the essential (Western cultural) ideas those texts embody, we will read closely (slowly and carefully) several major works, cornerstones of the Western canon:  Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales (The Franklin’s Tale), Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Milton’s Paradise Lost (Book I), Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, and Becket’s Waiting for Godot.\n","schedule":"Week 1:  Intro\nWeeks 2-4  　　Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales\nWeeks 5-8  　　Shakespeare, Hamlet\nWeeks 9-11  　　Milton, Paradise Lost\nWeeks 11-13 　　Dickens, A Christmas Carol\nWeeks 14-16　　Beckett, Waiting for Godot\n","scorePolicy":"Grades\nMidterm　　33.3%\nFinal 33.3%\nClass Work/Weekly Participation 33.3%\n","materials":"Attendance:   a combination of 4 absences or late days  =  -10 points from course grade\n","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
