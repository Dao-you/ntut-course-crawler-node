The details of the content and schedule is simply listed as follows:\n1. Introduction to Image Processing (Week 1)\n2. Hardware &amp; Software of Computer Vision (Week 2) – Video\n3. Image Statistics (Week 3) – Mean, STD, Correlation, Projection, Histogram\n4. Segmentation (Week 3~4)– Thresholding methods (e-Vision) Mean, Iterative, Maximal Entropy, and Otsu methods – Lab I- Fuse Inspection\n5. Enhancement (Week 5~7)– Smoothing, Sharpening (Filters)\n6. Calibration (Week 7)– e-Vision and self design with calibration rule or paper\n7. Measurement (Week 8) – point, line, circle, rectangle gauge design – Lab II – Fuse Pin Measurement\n8.Roundness Measurement (Week 8~9)—MIC, MCC, MZC\n9. Morphology (Week 9~10) – Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing, Thinning and its applications\n10. Color Image (10~11)– Image threshold and Measurement – Lab III- Melf Inspection\n11. Labeling (Week 11~12) – Blob analysis (e-Vision) and self design\n12. Matching (11~13)—template and feature based, applications : stereovision —Stereo face\n13. Face Recognition (Week 14~15)\n14. Invariant Object Recognition (Week 15~16)\n15. Transformation (Week 17) -- Textile Inspection – Gabor filter, Fourier Transform\n16.
