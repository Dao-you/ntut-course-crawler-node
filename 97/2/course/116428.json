Logic and language are inseparable. Students who have chosen language studies as a profession are obligated to think logically, and to argue analytically in the use of the language acquired. This course, however, is not intended to introduce theories of argumentation; nor does it seek to produce theoreticians of philosophy. It is, in his nature, a practical preparation for students who are about to engage in myriads of academic and professional tasks, which demand strong ability in critical reasoning and logic-based argumentation. The learning of the English language is also enhanced through the studies of the materials.\nCourse Objectives:  This course has its dual emphases and aims to help the students establish strong critical thinking and argumentation skills as well as learn the use the English language logically. Students will be able to\n(1)　　understand the basic principles of logic and the language   of logic\n(2)　　understand the framework of argumentation\n(3)　　identify the principal forms of illogical thinking\n(4)　　think, reason and argue analytically and critically\n(5)　　acquire and use key terms in simulated case debate\n","schedule":"Week/ Date　　Content Unit / Chapter\n1_ Feb. 18　　Orientation / What is critical thinking and how to improve it?\n2_ Feb. 25　　Identifying reasons and conclusions: the language of reasoning\n3_ Mar. 4　　Understanding reasoning: different patterns of reasoning\n4_ Mar. 11　　Understanding reasoning: assumptions, context and a thinking map\n5_ Mar. 18　　Evaluating inferences: deductive validity and other grounds\n6_ Mar. 25　　Evaluating inferences: assumptions and other relevant arguments\n7_ Apr. 1　　Reasoning about causal explanations\n8_ Apr. 8　　Midterm\n9_ Apr. 15　　What are the reasons? /What words and phrases are ambiguous?\n10_ Apr. 22　　What are the value conflicts and assumptions? / What are the descriptive assumptions?\n11_ Apr. 29　　Are there any fallacies in the reasoning? / Identifying flaws in the argument\n12_ May 6　　Evidence / How good is the evidence? / Finding and evaluating sources of evidence\n13_ May13　　Relevance: probative relevance, dialectical relevance, relevance in meetings and debates\n14_ May 20　　Relevance: relevance in legal argumentation, fear appeal arguments, etc\n15_ May 27　　The use and abuse of logic 1\n16_ Jun. 3　　The use and abuse of logic 2\n17_ Jun. 10　　The use and abuse of logic 3\n18_ Jun. 17　　Final Exam\n","scorePolicy":"Course requirements:\nEach student must fulfill the following requirements:\n(1)　　Study each chapter / unit assigned prior to class session.\n(2)　　Submit an elaborated outline of the chapter assigned for each week.
