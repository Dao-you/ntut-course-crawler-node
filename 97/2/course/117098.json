This course introduces the students the mechanical behaviour of the soil in the vicinity of deep basement excavation, pile foundation, and retaining wall. The course will first provide information for the design of propped and cantilever retaining walls constructed in stiff clay that frequently pose various problems. Selected case histories are given to illustrate the relevant design features. The second part of the course introduces the students the tools i.e. centrifuge and numerical modelling that are commonly used in the study of soil/structure interaction problem.","schedule":"Week 1 : Introduction\nWeek 2 : Soil/structure shear strength, earth pressures\nWeek 3 : Soil/structure shear strength, earth pressures\nWeek 4 : Measurement and Selection of Design Parameters (soil, water)\nWeek 5 : Measurement and Selection of Design Parameters (soil, water)\nWeek 6 : Temporary works, design of wall structures, grd. movement\nWeek 7 : Temporary works, design of wall structures, grd. movement\nWeek 8 : Presentation on Case Study\nWeek 9 : Midterm Exam Week\nWeek 10: Application of centrifuge in SSI\nWeek 11: Application of numerical modelling in SSI\nWeek 12: Introduction of a numerical tool – FLAC\nWeek 13: Soil constitutive models commonly used\nWeek 14: Incorporating soil models into FLAC\nWeek 15: FLAC Workshop\nWeek 16: FLAC Workshop\nWeek 17: Case Study Presentation\nWeek 18: Final Exam\n","scorePolicy":"1.
