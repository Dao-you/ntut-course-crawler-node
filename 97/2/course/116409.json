In preparation for such a project, we will discuss the basics of film theory and editing, emphasizing the special nature of film – what makes it distinct from other art forms – as a unique combination of image, word, and sound.  The script for this semester’s film will be an original story inspired by Dante’s The Divine Comedy, the classic Western text about a journey through heaven and hell.","schedule":"Week 1  Intro\n　　　　Production assignments\n\nWeek 2  Basics of Film Theory 1:  Image, Word, and Sound\n　　　　\nWeek 3:  Basics of Film Theory 2:  Using the Camera\n\nWeek 4:  Script review and production meeting (locations, set design, costumes)\n\nWeeks 5-12  Shooting schedule\n\nWeeks 13-17   Editing\n","scorePolicy":"　","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
