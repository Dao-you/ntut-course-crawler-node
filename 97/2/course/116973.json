Pre-requisition: Basic concepts in statistics \n2. Objectives: This course, Design of Experiments (DOE), is designed to provide students experimental methods to solve engineering problems.  Through the course, statistics will be adopted as the tool of approach.  In addition, a few case studies that are related to experimental planning, execution, analyses and decision making are also presented during the course.  The course will be lectured in the classroom by the instructor.  However, a few opportunities are also given to students for presenting their home work projects.  Students who are interested in or going to carry out their researches by experiments are suggested to take this course.  \n","schedule":"(1) Statistics Fundamentals for Engineering – A brief review \n��　　Terminology and jargons \n��　　Probability distribution, sampling、t-Test、F-Test, etc. \n��　　Test and hypotheses \n��　　The Tool: MS Excel\n(2) One-/multi-way DOE and ANOVA\n��　　General introduction and Steps of DOE\n��　　One-way ANOVA\n��　　Two-way ANOVA\n��　　DOE with multi-variates (optional) \n(3) Blocking in DOE\n��　　Complete Blocking \n��　　Incomplete Blocking \n(4) Latin Squares (optional)\n(5) Factorial Designs &amp; ANOVA\n��　　2k Full\n��　　Fractional \n(6) Regression Analyses\n��　　Linear\n��　　Response Surfaces (optional) \n(7) Robust Design: Taguchi’s method \n��　　Cf.
