Project I involves a writing of analysis on educational or social issues.  Students will be guided with strategies of critical reading and structures of analysis and formal critique so as to set forth thoughtful responses and formulate a coherent thesis and support it with evidences and arguments. Project II—Reading the News—emphasizes analysis and argumentation.  After carefully examining two newspaper articles describing the similar event or issue, students will learn to read critically and write their own analysis and viewpoints.","schedule":"2/20　　Enumeration　　  \n         The Old Days\n2/27　　Analysis　　           \n         Typical Science Fiction Film\n3/6　　Critical Thinking　　  \n         College is a Waste of Time and Money\n3/13　　College is a Waste of Time and Money\n3/20　　Argument--evidence　　\n         School as a Spin Control\n3/27　　Argument--logic　　  \n         Romance is a Poor Basis for Marriage\n4/3　　Argument--use of analogy　　\n4/10　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n4/17　　Project I finished\n4/24　　Comparison and Contrast　　\n         Two Colonial Attitudes toward Marriage\n5/1　　Browsing through the news--　　What’s the Story\n         NYT—Now Hip-Hop, Too, Is Made in China\n5/8　　Selecting a news event　　\n         The Noose Incident\n5/15　　Comparing and Contrasting Media (Re)Presentations　　\n5/22　　Arguing Your Point of View　　\n         An Appropriate Expression?\n5/29　　Arguing vs. Expressing Your Opinion　　\n         Ithacan Inquirer \n6/5　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n6/12　　Project II finished\n6/19　　Review and Discussion\n","scorePolicy":"Criteria for grading\n1.　　Project I: 35% (draft 1—10%; draft 2—10%; final draft: 15%)\n2.　　Project II: 35% (draft 1—10%; draft 2—10%; final draft: 15%)\n3.　　Assignments and In-class Practices: 30%\n","materials":"Pamela Gay.
