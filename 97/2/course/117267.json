The mechanical properties include Hookean Elastic Solid, Rubber Elastic Solid, Linear Viscoelasticity, Nonlinear Viscoelasticity, Anisotropic Mechanical Behavior, Brittle- Ductile Transition, and Molecular Relaxation Transition. This course is designed for graduate students who have taken basic polymer courses such as polymer chemistry and polymer physics. Course materials will focus on both theoretical and practical sides.\n","schedule":"Course Outline and Syllabus\n. Structure of Polymers (1 week)\n.The Deformation of an Elastic Solid (1 week)\n.
