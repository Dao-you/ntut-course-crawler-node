Moreover, technology has also become more complex, uncertain and expensive than ever before. Organization and enterprise customers have tightened their enthusiasm for tech spending, monitoring more carefully the returns from investments in technology. High-tech products and services are introduced in turbulent, chaotic environments where the odds of success are often difficult to ascertain. This course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of management of technology (MOT) with both micro (technology and firm) level and macro (sector and policy) level based on academic articles and case studies.  It is also designed to provide frameworks for systematic decision making about marketing in high-tech environments, to foresee the increasing impacts of technology innovation on business process reengineering, and to offer insights about how marketing tools and techniques must be adapted and modified for high-technology products and services.","schedule":"2/18 Course requirements and introduction\n2/25 Recognizing technology- \n    (1)definition, scope (2)components, capabilities (3) Life-cycle\n3/04 Acquiring technology (1): research and development\n3/11 Acquiring technology (2): technology transfer\n3/18 Exploiting technology: strategic alliance\n3/25 Technology strategy\n4/01 Technology planning\n4/08 The process of technological innovation\n4/15 Mid-term exam\n4/22 Technology appraising\n4/29 The design of organizations and reengineering\n5/06 Case studies\n5/13 Introduction to High Technology Marketing\n5/20 Segmentation, targeting and positioning \n5/27 Marketing strategy and decision making\n6/03 Marketing research in High-Tech markets\n6/10 Understanding High-Tech customers\n6/17 E-business, E-Commerce and the Internet\n","scorePolicy":"1.Participation and discussion (10%)\n2.Group project for mid-term (30%)\n3.Mid-term exam (20%)\n4.Case study for final-term (40%)\n","materials":"1.科技管理理論與應用 陳澤義著 華泰出版\n2.Tarek Khall(2000), ”Management of Technology” \n3.Mohr, Jakki, Sanjit Sengupta, and Stanley Slater (2005), “Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations” 2nd Ed","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
