Emphasis will be on developing a working terminology by which to discuss and write about literary works.  Thus we will learn how to employ terms such as character, setting, mood, style, plot and conflict.  In so doing we will learn to appreciate the spiritual, aesthetic, political and philosophical usages, demands and delights of literature.","schedule":"February 12　　Introduction:  Whitman’s “Song of Myself”\n\nFeb 19　　　　O Henry’s “While the Auto Waits”\n\nFeb 26　　　　Baudelaire’s “The Eyes of the Poor”\n\nMarch 5　　Blake’s “Songs of Innocence and Experience”\n\nMarch 12　　Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland (selection)\n\nMarch 19　　Frost Poems\n\nMarch 26　　Thurber’s “The Night the Bed Fell In”\n\nApril 2　　Midterm Examination\n\nApril 9　　Coleridge’s “Xanadu”\n\nApril 16　　Swift’s “A Modest Proposal”\n\nApril 23　　Poems by Dylan Thomas\n \nApril 30　　“The Debutante” by Leonora Carrington\n\nMay 7　　　　Poems by Langston Hughes\n\nMay 14　　Poems by Gwendolyn Brooks\n\nMay 21　　Kerouac’s On the Road (selection)　　\n\nJune 4　　　　Allen Ginsberg’s Howl\n\nJune 11　　FINAL EXAMINATION\n\n","scorePolicy":"GRADING\n\n25%　　Midterm Exam　　　　　　　　\n25%　　Participation\n25%　　Journal Assignments　　　　　　　　\n25%　　Final Exam\n","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
