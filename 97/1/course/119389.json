[{"name":"周素鳳","email":"sfchou@ntut.edu.tw","latestUpdate":"2008-09-08 20:40:36","objective":"In the first semester, Intermediate English Writing is specifically designed to enhance the student’s ability to present a clear, concise, coherent expository essay (Project I—Recollection and Reflection) and a well-organized argumentative essay with a well-articulated thesis statement, sound reasoning and support (Project II—Character Analysis).  Throughout the course, students will learn to develop their writing through dialogic interactions with texts, through class discussion and other collaborative class practices, and through sequenced assignments.\nIn addition to the essays which aim to demonstrate essential writing skills, Jodi Picoult’s My Sister’s Keeper is especially selected for Project II. Students are required to compile a reading portfolio to demonstrate their progress as a close reader and reflective writer. It is hoped that through such an approach, students’ vocabulary power will be enriched, their ability in literary analysis cultivated, and their writing skill advanced.\n","schedule":"9/12　　Introduction/ Misconceptions about Writing\n9/19　　Finding the Topic /“Gary Larson’s Cartoon”/My Sister’s  Keeper(pp. 1-21)\n9/26/　　Observing　　Reading a Painting/ M: 22-43\n10/3　　Free Association/“Prospect Park”/M: 44-68\n10/10　　Holiday\n10/17　　Finding the Central Idea/“The Match”/M: 69-101\n10/24　　Moving toward  Significance/“Daddy Tucked…”/M: 102-117\n10/31　　Dialogue with a Text /M: 118-139\n11/7　　Review and Discussion /M: 140-196\n11/14　　Summary/“Story of an Hour”/M: 197--264\n11/21　　Paraphrase &amp; Reader’s Response/“The Ticket”/M: 265-326\n11/28　　Character Analysis　　/“Cat in the Rain”/M: 327-389\n12/5　　Writing an Analysis /M:390-423\n12/12　　Developing an Argument/“Necklace”/M:425-500\n12/19　　Explaining the Significance of the Support\n12/26　　One-to-one discussion with the teacher\n1/2　　“Song: Love Armed”\n1/9　　Review and Discussion\n","scorePolicy":"Criteria for Grading\n1.Project I--35% (1st draft: 10% +2nd draft: 10% +final\ndraft: 15%\n2.Project II—40% (reading portfolio: 10%+ 1st draft: 10%\n+ revised draft: 20%)\n3.Attendance, In class practice, Peer-reviewing and comments,\nAssignments: 25%\n","materials":"Textbooks:\n1.
