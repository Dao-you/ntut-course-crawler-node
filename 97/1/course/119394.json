Students learn to select topics, collect essential information, analyze the audience, organize materials, improve delivery skills, distinguish different types of speeches, and further to evaluate their own and others’ speeches. Each student is expected to deliver at least 3-4 individual speeches, and 2-3 debates. Speech topics will be assigned to students. Any modifications of the speech topics will have to be approved by the instructor. All student speech sessions must be videotaped.(*1)\nCourse Requirements: 　　Students’ responsibilities in this class include:\n(1)　　Attending class regularly and to arrive on time: a sign-in sheet to record attendance / a grade reduction of 5% of the semester grade for each class session missed absence\n(2)　　All presentations assigned\n(3)　　Delivering speeches as scheduled:\ni.　　Students are required to present their speeches on the day scheduled;\nii.　　Make-up speech will be allowed only when the failure to perform is due to an officially excused absence at the instructor’s discretion.\niii.　　The ideal time duration for each speech is 4 to 6 minutes. The minimum length of speech time is 3 minutes, and the maximum 6 minutes. Violation of the time limit (less than 3 and more than 6) will create a 10-point deduction. The time length for debates will vary due to the different formats employed.\n(4)　　Submitting to the instructor a speaker’s dossier with inclusion of the outlined speech as well as its full-length version, the self-evaluating commentary of previous presentation(s) and also blank A-4 size lined sheets for notes and feedbacks (see Appendix 1) when presenting the speech. Failure to submit will generate a penalty of 20 points (out of 100) in each speech. Students who fail to comply with the outline format requirements (sampled and specified below) will forfeit the opportunity to deliver the current speech / debate.\n(5)　　Distributing the current speech outline(s) to fellow students at the beginning of each class session\n(6)　　Evaluating one’s own speech: all speeches have to be videotaped by the student speaker. Student speakers are required to watch their own videotaped performance, observe their own speeches, and later submit a self-evaluating commentary to the instructor a week after the speech presentation. Students are strongly advised to use their own videotaping devices. A complete portfolio needs to be established and submitted at the semester end.\n(7)　　Offering constructive opinions and feedbacks of the fellow students as speakers: Students are encouraged to give verbal / oral commentary of the fellow students’ speeches, and with the objectively constructed criticism, the student evaluators will earn 3% grade points to their semester grades.\n","schedule":"Public Speaking and Debate_ Weekly Schedule, Fall 2008\nWeek_ Date　　Session Task 　　Session Administrator(s)　　Note\n1_0908　　Orientation 　　Dr. Yang\n2_0915　　General Public Speaking Guidelines　　Dr. Yang\n3_0922　　Introductory Speech 　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students 　　Impromptu (2-3 mins)\n4_0929　　Guidelines for Informative / Persuasive Speech　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students\n5_1006　　Delivery of Informative Speeches (1)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students　　Extemporaneous (3-4 mins)\n6_1013　　Delivery of Informative Speeches (2)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students　　Extemporaneous (3-4 mins)\n7_1020　　Delivery of Persuasive Speeches_ General Human Interest (1)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students　　Memorized\n(4-5 mins)\n8_1027　　Delivery of Persuasive Speeches_ General Human Interest (2)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students　　Memorized\n(4-5 mins)\n9_1103　　Delivery of Analytical Speech_ Social / Public Concerns (1)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students　　Memorized\n(4-5 mins)\n10_1110　　Delivery of Analytical Speeches_ Social / Public Concerns (2)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students　　Memorized\n(4-5 mins)\n11_1117　　Guidelines for Debate　　Dr. Yang\n12_1124　　Preparing for Debate (Standard)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students\n13_1201　　Debate 1-1 (Standard)  　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students\n14_1208　　Debate 1-2 (Standard)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students\n15_1215　　Preparing for Debate (Cross-Ex.) 　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students\n16_1222　　Debate 2-1 (Cross-Ex.)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students\n17_1229　　Debate 2-2 (Cross-Ex.)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students\n18_0105　　Final Debate Match (Lincoln-Douglas)　　Dr. Yang &amp; Students\n*The above weekly schedule is subject to necessary modifications as the class proceeds.\nSpeech Topics: Choose ONE for the following topics\n(A)　　Introductory Speech Topics\n1.　　Will I ever go from rags to riches?\n2.　　Things That Trouble Me Most in My College Life\n3.　　How Misery Loves Company: My Story\n4.　　Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining: My Story\n5.　　How many baskets do you have to hold all your eggs?

Each absence will generate 5% point deduction of the semester grades on the 100% scale.\n*3) All extemporaneous speeches allow speakers to deliver the speech with its outline / note card. Speech delivery with full-length script will result in the total loss of the component grade.\n*4) The implementation of the final debate match will likely to be subject to certain contingent occurrences as the class proceeds. Exact date, format and related matters will have to be discussed and determined later in the semester.\n* 5) Students are required to submit the speech assessment portfolio at the end of the semester. Failure to submit the portfolio will override the grades received in other grading components and thus results in a failing grade.\n","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
