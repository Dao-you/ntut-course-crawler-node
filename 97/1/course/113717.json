Students will read and discuss primary and secondary sources from Eastern and Western wisdom traditions and compose four short (3-5 page) papers and one medium length (5-8 page) essay based on these works.  Today, the first day of class, you will select a primary text at random from those I have available.  Your research topic for this semester will be derived from this original source, but it will be your responsibility to find more research materials--books, articles, films, interviews, musical compositions, poems, stories: anything that can be documented-- on your topic.  It will also be up to you to find an angle on your material: perhaps it will be a study of the culture, mythology, religion, or lifestyle from which your original source is drawn. Perhaps it will be a comparative work—examining beliefs from more than one culture.  Perhaps it will be an examination of music, art or literature contemporaneous with your source text As long as your final result includes the first text you selected in some significant manner, you will have accomplished the task I am assigning.","schedule":"All assignments are due next class session unless otherwise indicated.
