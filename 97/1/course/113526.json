Close attention will also be directed to the productive uses of learning tools and related online resources with the hope to expand the one-semester course into a sustainable pursuit for ongoing improvement of your English conversation ability.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThe course adopts an interactive approach to language learning by providing you with ample opportunities for actual listening and speaking practices based both on the textbook lessons and in-class activities like Bingo game and interviews. An optional course project will be announced after the mid-term examination; students are encouraged to grasp the opportunity to earn extra (bonus) grades. The instructor also places considerable emphasis on exploring together with you some effective ways and tools for learning English and improving one’s English conversation and listening abilities.\n\nCourse Schedule\n\nSeptember 8 / School Opening Ceremony\nSeptember 15 / Course Orientation – I AM Learning English\nSeptember 22 / Using English-English Dictionaries – Why and How\nSeptember 29 / Unit 1: Party Talk\nOctober 6　　 / Unit 2: Weekend at Home\nOctober 13 / Unit 3: You Haven’t Changed a Bit\nOctober 20 / Unit 4: Pen Pals and Keypals\nOctober 27 / Mid-Term Course Review\nNovember 3 / Mid-Term Examination\nNovember 10 / Unit 5: Let’s Get Something to Eat\nNovember 17 / Eating and Drinking\nNovember 24 / Unit 6: Let’s Party\nDecember 1 / Bingo Game\nDecember 8 / Unit 7: Sightseeing\nDecember 15 / Travel &amp; Leisure\nDecember 22 / Unit 8: You’re the One for Me\nDecember 29 / Final Course Review\nJanuary 5　　 / Final Examination\n","scorePolicy":"Course Requirements\n\nYour instructor teaches the course with the basic assumption that you are taking the course because you have a strong desire to improve your English speaking ability. The most crucial course requirement is therefore for you to constantly demonstrate that desire to the instructor, and one of the best ways to do that is for you to come to the class fully prepared to TALK.\n\nIn addition to the above course introduction, please read through the following important notes about Oral-Aural Drills in English to confirm your drop-and-add decision:\n\nI.\nLectures on the instructor’s part will be primarily in English followed by Chinese synopsis (that is, approximately 60% in English and 40% in Chinese).\n\nII.\nThe instructor will do his best to create a relaxed and friendly learning ambience to facilitate your class participation which is a must for this course. Any failure to raise questions, answer questions or enter discussions will seriously jeopardize your grade. Please keep in mind this rationale (underlying principle) of your instructor’s teaching: “It you do not talk, then why should I?!”\n\nIII.\nIn the case of unavoidable absence, you are required to inform the instructor of the reason (prior to the absence, if possible) by e-mail. Students found absent without any previous notice are top candidates for class failure.\n\nGrading Criteria\nMid-Term Examination: 30%\nFinal Examination: 30%\nQuizzes and Assignments: 20%\nAttendance &amp; Participation: 20%\nCourse Project: Extra Bonus\n","materials":"Lougheed, Lin.
