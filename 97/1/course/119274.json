The physical principles of each technique are explained in simple terms, and their applicability to specific industrial needs is discussed on the basis of wide hands-on experience. A large number of practical applications to in-process industrial sensing and metrology are described. Topics include on-line surface inspection, 3-D imaging, nondestructive testing, fiber-optic sensors, robot guidance, as well as spectroscopic and light-scattering process analyzers.","schedule":"1　　製程監測介紹\n2　　基礎聲學原理\n3　　鋁鎂合金高溫製程及時監測 (廖駿偉)\n4　　基礎光學原理\n5　　紅外線熱影像原理及影像處理\n6　　紅外線技術於線上監控之應用\n7　　雷射超音波在製程監測上之應用\n8　　超音波在製程監測上之應用 \n9　　期中考\n10　　線上表面特性及3D輪廓監測\n11　　光纖技術在製程監測上之應用\n12　　自動化光學檢測在製程監測上之應用\n13　　非破壞檢測技術\n14　　遠端網路時監測(NI or MOSA)\n15　　製程電子封裝技術\n16　　校外參觀\n17　　元旦假期\n18　　期末考\n","scorePolicy":"Final (40%), midterm (30%), report (20%), homework (10%)","materials":"1.　　Theory and Practice of Infrared Technology for Nondestructive Testing - Xavier P.
