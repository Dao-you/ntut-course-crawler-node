The focus is on the managerial and technical aspects of creating and managing modern IT enabled and integrated enterprises. It is clear that enterprises have been in rapid transition toward virtual enterprises with value chain integration for high efficiency and efficacy. Management styles based on hierarchical command and control structures have been challenged both within an enterprise and among enterprises.  Information systems are being realigned around business processes, and business-to-business (B2B) electronic commerce (or some call it “e-business”) has become a key competence that business cannot survive without. This course provides such understanding by focusing on all aspects of managing this complex e-business oprocesses, from strategic planning to the technologies of modern enterprise application integration (EAI). The course stresses the importance of hands-on and creative training. Students will be asked to form project teams and complete term projects/term papers based on eEI techniques and tools introduced during the lectures for practical applications and case studies.","schedule":"1.
