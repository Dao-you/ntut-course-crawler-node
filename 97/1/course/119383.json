In the course of practicing such skills, we will explore the concept of conversation as story-telling, in particular a mutual exchange of stories.  Our topics will include: stories from film and other forms of popular culture;  stories and their genres (romance, science fiction, horror, adventure);  descriptive accounts of paintings and objects;  non-fiction accounts of historical people and events;  narratives of our own personal history and invention.\n\n","schedule":"Freshman Conversation         W 1-3\n\nWeek 1　　9/10　　Intro:  summer vacation\nWeek 2　　9/17　　Personal Narrative:  A Story of Anger, Jealousy, or Fear\nWeek 3　　9/24　　　　continued　　\nWeek 4　　10/1　　 Super powers:  If I could . . .
