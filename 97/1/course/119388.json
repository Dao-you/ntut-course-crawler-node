In the course of practicing such skills, we will follow from our reading class and take as our general topic the concept of sport and culture, with a special focus on conversation as a free, improvised, exchange of ideas (as opposed to the prepared speeches required for public speaking and dramatic performances).  Our topics will include:  stories from film and books; non-fiction accounts of famous athletes and sporting events; narratives of our own personal accomplishments (athletic and otherwise).  \n\n","schedule":"Week 1　　9/8　　Intro\nWeek 2　　9/15　　Childhood Hero (“Who I wanted to be”)\nWeek 3　　9/22　　　　part 2\nWeek 4　　9/29　　no class [typhoon]\nWeek 5　　10/6　　Formative Memory\nWeek 6　　10/13　　　　continued 　　\nWeek 7　　10/20　　Reports on baseball and culture　　　　　　　　\nWeek 8　　10.27　　　　continued\nWeek 9　　11/3　　MIDTERM\nWeek 10　　11/10　　Group story　　\nWeek 11　　11/17　　Interview:  famous athlete\nWeek 12　　11/24　　　　continued　　\nWeek 13　　12/1　　News report:  “sports” in the news  on the non-sports pages　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 (politics, business, history, science)\nWeek 14　　12/8  　　　　 continued\nWeek 15　　12/15　　 20 Questions　　\nWeek 16　　12/22　　Film:   Eight Men Out\nWeek 17　　12/29　　film discussion\n","scorePolicy":"Grades:\n　　Midterm  　　33.3%\n　　Final  　　　　33.3%\n　　Participation  　　33.3%\n\nGrading for midterm and final projects on will be based on criteria such as clarity, fluency, originality, and effort.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\n \n","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
