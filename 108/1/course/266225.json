By the end of the lecture, the concept of organic Rankine cycle will be emphasized herein because it can recover a certain amount of extra power from low-temperature, low-enthalpy heat by accompany of the environment temperature and appropriate using of working fluids. What the lecture will cover are:\n1. Brief review of Thermodynamics 2. Introduction of ORC 3. Difference from steam Rankine cycle 4. Selection in working fluid &amp; System efficiency 5. Heat source and heat sink 6. System components design 7. ORC application 8. System optimization 9. ORC related issues of global warming, carbon tax, etc.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction to this class\nWeek 2~6: Brief review of Thermodynamics (5 weeks)\n  A. Briefly review the background of thermodynamic properties, first and second laws of thermodynamics.\n  B. Deeply figure out how Carnot cycle helps the promotion in the system performance and applications. Learn the conversion between T-s and P-v diagrams.\n  C. Understand Brayton gas cycle and implement the analyses by combining the concept of Carnot cycle to enhance the cycle efficiency. Similar concept can be employed in all other gas cycles.\n  D.
