The course will investigate the historical and social contexts, and examine the authors’ innovation in poetic language, dramatic structure, and theatre. We will also examine various texts ranging from music, opera, paintings, plays, and films. We will also compare and contrast how the themes of love, power, and death were presented differently. By reviewing film adaptations of selected Shakespeare plays, students will learn theatrical and cinematic terms, canonical Shakespearean auteurs, scholars, and literary theories.","schedule":"The Middle Ages\nWeek 1: Introduction: The Canterbury Tales \nWeek 2: The Prologue and The Knight’s Tale\nWeek 3: The Miller’s Tale, The Prologue of Wife of Bath and the Wife of Bath’s Tale\nWeek 4: The Pardoner’s Tale and The Nun’s Priest’s Tale\nThe Renaissance\nWeek 5: The Renaissance.
