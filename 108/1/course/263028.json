The theme of this course is to encourage students to participate in the discovery of laws and wonder of nature. And to solidate the foundation for the particular courses of study for different departments. The contents of this course include mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, optics, and foundation of modern physics, etc.. The lecturers will design this course under deliberating the differences of each departments to emphasize or to omit some contents. The course is designed for 6 credits for two semesters; 3 credits for each semester,  and 3 lecture hours per week.","schedule":"直線與向量運動(2周)\n動能與功(2周)\n位能與能量守恆(2周)\n質心與轉動(2周)\n期中考\n滾動與角動量(2周)\n重力與流體(2周)\n波(2周)\n熱力學(2周)\n期末考","scorePolicy":"Quiz 15%\nMidterm 35 %\nFinal term 35 %\nNotes 5 %。\nAttendance 10%","materials":"Fundamentals of Physics (11st Ed.) \nAuthor : Halliday, Resnick and Jearl Walker.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
