Since the field of law is very broad but the time is limited, this course can briefly explain common principles of law, complex phenomena of law, etc. The main purpose of this course is to let students catch the concept of common principles of \"lex scripta.\"  Also, this course aims to promote students' knowledge about law, thus cultivating their spirit of abiding by law.  This course will introduce the basic concept and theory of law first. Then students will be given logical training through discussion.  Besides, the general cases and problems of law will be covered as well. Through this course, students can not only get correct concepts of law, but learn to protect their/others' right.","schedule":"第一週","scorePolicy":"平時30%\n期中考30%\n期末考 40 %","materials":"陳惠馨 法學概論 第16版","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
