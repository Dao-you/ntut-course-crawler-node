Conversions among T-v, p-v, and T-s diagrams.\n15-16. Brayton cycle and improvement\n17-18. Rankine cycle and improvement","scorePolicy":"About 2 mid-terms and 1 final examinations: Date will be determined according to the progress of the lecture.\nYour final points will be completely dependent of what you can show yourself in the examinations and special performance in the class. Homework will be assigned but you do not have to hand in. They will be the candidate problems in the examinations. You can freely handin your homework and would be helpful in your grade.","materials":"1. 教科書：”Thermodynamics” – by William Z. Black and James G.
