Students will learn to mathematically describe the response of SDOF systems with and without damping to free vibration, harmonic, and arbitrary excitations. Students will learn to compute the dynamic response of structural components (like beams, walls, and columns) and structural systems under dynamic loads such as blast and earthquake excitations. Lumped and distributed mass systems including modal analysis of MDOF systems will be covered.&nbsp;Moreover, the fundamentals of spectrum analysis and its application in earthquake engineering are also covered to provide the student an insight into the benefit from dynamic analysis.","schedule":"(1) 結構動力學簡介 (Introduction)\n(2) 自由振動分析 (Free vibration analysis)\n(3) 受到諧和載重之反應分析 (Response to harmonic loading)\n(4) 受到週期載重之反應分析 (Response to periodic loading)\n(5) 受到衝擊載重之反應分析 (Response to impulsive loading)\n(6) 受到一般載重之反應分析(疊加法) Response to arbitrary loading - Duhamel integral\n(7) 受到一般載重之反應分析(逐步積分法) Response to arbitrary loading - step-by-step integration method\n(8) 反應譜 (Response spectra)\n(9) 反應譜在耐震設計之應用 (Application of response spectra)\n(10) 廣義單自由度系統 (Generalized single degree of freedom system)\n(11) 多自由度系統之運動方程式 (Equations of motion for MDOF system)\n(12) 多自由度系統之結構特性矩陣 (Formulations of structural matrices for MDOF system)\n(13) 多自由度系統自由振動分析 (Free vibration analysis for MDOF system)\n(14) 多自由度系統之振態疊加法 (Modal superposition method)","scorePolicy":"Homework(25%)，Midterm Examination(35%)，Final Examination(40%)\n作業遲交打七折，超過一週不計分","materials":"Dynamics of Structures (高立圖書公司)","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
