With panel discussion, research report and design practice, graduate students can be able to learn the ability of research, analysis and practice by effectively exchange opinions and personal experience. The aim of interaction design is to integrate different disciplines from computer science, mechatronics, human-culture and design and art so as to foster the profession of interaction design. Therefore, one of the aims of this course is to construct multi-disciplines learning environment which performs a topic-oriented study model. This study model formulates the graduate students of design, art, information and mechatronic disciplines to collaborate on an interactive media design project. It may execute interaction design by working with the form of the case study or design creation.","schedule":"Design studio helps to develop student’s research abilities to identify problems, envision current and future needs, and provide validated solutions to these problems and needs through interaction design.\n\nWeek 01-03  Introduction\nWeek 04-09  Problem 1\nWeek 10-18  Problem 2","scorePolicy":"Participation &amp; Final Project","materials":"Kim Erwin, Communicating the New, Methods to Shape and Accelerate Innovation, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. 2014","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true},{"name":"陳圳卿","email":"cceugene@ntut.edu.tw","latestUpdate":"2019-06-06 12:32:40","objective":"Design studio helps to develop student’s research abilities to identify problems, envision current and future needs, and provide validated solutions to these problems and needs through interaction design.","schedule":"Week 01-03  Introduction\nWeek 04-09  Problem 1\nWeek 10-18  Problem 2Participation &amp; Final Project","scorePolicy":"Final presentation 100%","materials":"Textbook or Journal related to interaction design","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true},{"name":"戴楠青","email":"nctai@ntut.edu.tw","latestUpdate":"2019-06-02 23:38:04","objective":"Design studio helps to develop student’s research abilities to identify problems, envision current and future needs, and provide validated solutions to these problems and needs through interaction design.","schedule":"Week 01-03  Introduction\nWeek 04-09  Problem 1\nWeek 10-18  Problem 2","scorePolicy":"Participation &amp; Final Project","materials":"None","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
