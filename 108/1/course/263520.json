Vehicle Models including plane and space motions will be detailed deduced. The application and development of these models to vehicle performance, handling and ride will be discussed. The effects of suspension, steering geometry, and tyre mechanics on handling are also covered.","schedule":"1.Introduction, Tyre Characteristics\n2.Tyre Mechanics\n3.Tyre Mechanics\n4.Tyre Mechanics\n5.Equations of Motion (Newtonian)\n6.Vehicle Peformance\n7.Four-Wheel Drive\n8.Braking\n9.Midterm\n10.2 d.o.f.
