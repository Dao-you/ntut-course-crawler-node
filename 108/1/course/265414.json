With current warming trend proceeds at an unprecedented rate, climate change poses a threat to all countries. In the IPCC assessment reports, much of scientific evidence indicates climate change an unalterable fact, so in order to meet the needs of present generations without jeopardizing the ability of futures generations to meet their own need, approaches on \"mitigation\" and \"adaptation\" needed to be adopted in response to climate change. \nTaiwan is vulnerable and at high risk to climate change because of geographic exposure and climatic conditions. Extreme weather events, such as heat wave, typhoon, and flood, bring catastrophic damages in Taiwan. Hence, proper climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures needed to be taken proactively to reduce many of the adverse impacts and to enhance beneficial impacts.
