The solution process includes data collection and problem investigation, model formulation, optimal solution derivation, cost and efficiency analysis, system implementation and execution etc. This course mainly contains various application cases. Accordingly, participant can understand how to apply theoretical methods on solving real problems. Computational software is also utilized to solve the formulated models and analyze and interpret the obtained solutions.","schedule":"W1 Introduction to Management Science\u000b\nW2 Introduction to Data Analysis (Classroom 735, bring your laptop, Prof. Chiu)\nW3 Application problems \nW4 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\n\u000bW5 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo\u000b\nW6 Linear programming: application problems solved with Lingo \nW7 Linear programming: Duality\u000b\nW8 Goal programming (Homework 1 due: L3 currency, practice 1, 2)\u000b\nW9 Integer linear programming: application problems \u000b\nW10 Integer linear programming: application problems \u000b\nW11 Integer linear programming: application problems+Review \u000b\nW12 Exam (11/25)\u000b\nW13 Exam review and decision making\u000b\nW14 Data analysis (Prof. Chiu) \u000b\nW15 Data analysis (Prof. Chiu)\nW16 Data analysis (Prof. Chiu)\nW17 Data analysis (Prof. Chiu)\nW18 Final exam (Prof. Chiu)","scorePolicy":"Homework: 10% \nMid-Exam: 30%\nFinal-Exam: 30%\nPresent situation: 30% (No more than three absences)","materials":"Textbook:\nHamdy A.
