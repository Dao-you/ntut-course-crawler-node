Consequently, these skills will provide the student with a basis to conduct their own such analyzes and to evaluate critically others’ uses of statistics.","schedule":"Week 1 Introduction to statistics, data Summary, and presentation\nWeek 2 Probability, Bayesian theorem, correlation\nWeek 3 Random variables and probability distributions – Random variables, probability\nWeek 4 Random variables and probability distributions – Continuous random variables\nWeek 5 Random variables and probability distributions – Discrete random variables\nWeek 6 Decision making for a single sample – Estimation, hypothesis testing\nWeek 7 Decision making for a single sample – Inference on the mean of a population\nWeek 8 Quiz, independent Study\nWeek 9 Midterm exam (In-class, 1 Cheat Sheet, Calculator)\nWeek 10　　Decision making for a single sample – Inference on the variance of a normal population\nWeek 11　　Decision making for a single sample – Inference on a population proportion, goodness of fit test\nWeek 12　　Decision making for two samples – Inference on the means of two populations (Part I)\nWeek 13　　Decision making for two samples – Inference on the means of two populations (Part II)\nWeek 14　　Decision making for two samples – Paired t-test, inference on the ratio of variances of two normal populations\nWeek 15　　Decision making for two samples – Inference on two population proportions\nWeek 16　　Building Empirical Models – Simple Linear Regression\nWeek 17　　Quiz, independent Study\nWeek 18　　Final exam","scorePolicy":"1.
