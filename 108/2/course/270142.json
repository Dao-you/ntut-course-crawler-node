The pedagogy of the course is inspired from the Bauhaus, which is one of the most significant modern movements in the history of art and design.  \nIn class, the mission is to guide the students to experiment the variety of geometric shapes, from lines to circles and from circles to triangles, pursuing the essence and the spirits within the contemporary art. As practicing visual arts, the students not only learn how to develop an artwork, but also rethink the significant relation between art forms and meanings through the tutor-led and group discussions.\n\nNote: Students who want to take the course, must attend the first lesson to understand the course rules and requirements.","schedule":"1.
