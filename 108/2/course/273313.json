Spectroscopy methods include ultraviolet, visible, infrared, nuclear magnetic, and x-ray spectroscopies.Election and mass spectrometry are also included. Separation methods are: gas, liquid, and gel chromatographies. In addition, GC-MS,LC-MS, GC-IR, etc. will be studied.","schedule":"2/21 (W1) Introduction of course \n2/28 (W2) Peace Memorial Day\n3/06 (W3) Introduction of NMR\n3/13 (W4) Application of NMR\n3/20 (W5) Introduction of IR\n3/27 (W6) Application of IR\n4/03 (W7) Compensatory Leave\n4/10 (W8) Mid-Exam (Report)\n4/17 (W9) Introduction of UV\n4/24 (W10) Application of UV\n5/01 (W11) Introduction of FL and PL\n5/08 (W12) Application of FL and PL\n5/15 (W13) Introduction of Raman\n5/22 (W14) Application of Raman \n5/29 (W15) Introduction of POM\n6/05 (W16) Application of POM\n6/12 (W17) Introduction of MS\n6/19 (W18) Final-Exam","scorePolicy":"Mid-Exam (report) 30%\nFinal-Exam 40%\nAttendance 30%","materials":"Organic Spectrum \nHandout","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
