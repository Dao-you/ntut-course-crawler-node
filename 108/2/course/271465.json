In the course of practicing such skills, we will focus on an idea central to understanding the language and the culture of the West, and thus an idea central to understanding the people (their values, motivations, principles) of Western culture.   [Past topics for this course include: Monsters and the Human; Comedy and Humor; The Nature of Good and Evil; The Hero in the West; Baseball and Society; The Idea and the Importance of Beauty; Exploration and Discovery].   Examining essays and films centered around such a topic, we will consider what the significant idea tells us about Western society and its people.","schedule":"Week 1                       　　     Introduction\nWeek 2-4                          Unit 1\nWeek 5-8                           Unit 2\nWeek 9　　Class Midterm\nWeek 10-13                       Unit 4\nWeek 13-17                       Unit 5\nWeek 18          Class Final","scorePolicy":"Grades: \n　　 　　Midterm  50%\n　　　　Final　　    50%\n\nAttendance:   a combination of 4 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade","materials":"Course reader","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
