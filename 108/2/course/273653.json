After completing the course, the students would be able to understand and choose appropriate instrumentation for imaging and materials analysis by comparing the performance and limitation of different methods for a given situation. Techniques involved in photon and electron interactions with matter would be discussed in this course.","schedule":"1. LIGHT MICROSCOPY\n2. X-RAY DIFFRACTION METHODS\n3.
