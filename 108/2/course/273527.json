The readings include a variety of viewpoints on global topics centered around social issues, the environment, psychology, business, and technology. Extension activities are designed to encourage students to go beyond the reading text, and to put what they acquire from the readings into listening, speaking and writing practices.","schedule":"Week                       Topic\n  1           U6A: Shot on location\n  2           U6B: Judging by appearances\n  3           U6A&amp;6B: Grammar &amp; Vocabulary\n  4           U7A: Extraordinary school for boys\n  5           U7B: Ideal home\n  6           U7A&amp;7B: Grammar &amp; Vocabulary\n  7           U8A: Sell and tell\n  8           U8B: What's the right job for you?\n  9           Midterm exam\n10           U9A: Lucky encounters\n11           U9B: Too much information!\n12           U9A&amp;9B: Grammar &amp; Vocabulary\n13           U10A: Modern icons\n14           U10B: Two crimes stories\n15           U10A&amp;10B: Grammar &amp; Vocabulary\n16           Outside Reading\n17           Review final exam\n18           Final exam","scorePolicy":"Grading criteria:\n1.
