By integrating subjective opinions of managers and objective input and output data, participant can learn how to construct a reasonable evaluation method. Moreover, decision ball not only visualizes the evaluation results but shows the clustering and similarity of decision making units. According to the evaluation results, managers can derive future development or enhancement plans.","schedule":"3/16 多評準決策方法說明與實作\n3/23 多評準決策方法說明與實作\n3/30 多評準決策方法說明與實作","scorePolicy":"上課討論","materials":"期刊文章","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false},{"name":"蔡榮發","email":"jftsai@ntut.edu.tw","latestUpdate":"2019-12-16 14:17:53","objective":"本課程主要運用數量方法解析管理與決策問題，所談到的方法包括資料包絡分析法、分析層級程序法、分析網路程序法與各種最佳化方法。應用問題包括：原物料切割問題、船席規畫問題、投資組合問題、管理績效評估、多磁碟系統配置、能力集合分析與供應鏈管理問題等。此外，相關之文獻及各種應用將深入討論。","schedule":"W1 Introduction to quantitative management and decision making\nW2 DEA\nW3 AHP (assign term paper topic)\nW4 paper presentation and discussion \nW5 paper presentation and discussion \nW6 paper presentation and discussion\nW7 paper presentation and discussion\nW8 paper presentation and discussion \nW9 paper presentation and discussion \nW10 paper presentation and discussion\nW11 paper presentation and discussion\nW12 paper presentation and discussion\nW13 paper presentation and discussion\nW14 Optimization methods and applications \nW15 Term paper presentation\nW16 Term paper presentation\nW17 Term paper presentation\nW18 Final discussion","scorePolicy":"Presentation: 50% (25% for each)\nPaper: 30%\n上課討論與出席情況: 20%","materials":"References:\n1.Deterministic global optimization: theory, algorithms and applications (Christodoulos A.
