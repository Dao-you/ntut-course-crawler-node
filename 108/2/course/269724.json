We will do flipped classroom. \n\nAnalytical chemistry is the branch of chemistry that explores what the chemical and biochemical world around us is made of, splitting substances apart to examine their constituent components. Analytical chemists use a range of methodologies to separate, identify and determine the relative quantity of components with the aim of establishing the make-up of a chemical substance. We will cover a range of methodologies such as chromatography, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis, all of which are fundamental to the modern analytical chemist.","schedule":"1.

Every week a team need to assign a chapter to the class one week before, lecture it on the class, and give quiz and grade your classmates. For other students, each absence or fail to pass the in-class quiz will deduct 5 points from your final grades.","materials":"Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry, 9th Edition, by Douglas A.
