An understanding of this process and its different mechanisms requires you to connect principles of thermodynamics and fluid flow with those of heat transfer. A study of this lecture will teach you how to model the concepts of different modes or mechanisms of heat transfer for practical engineering applications.","schedule":"week 1: introduction\nweek 2: The Heat Diffusion Equation\nweek 3: One-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction\nweek 4: One-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction\nweek 5: Thermal Resistance\nweek 6: Heat Transfer from Extended Surfaces\nweek 7: Two-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction\nweek 8: Two-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction\nweek 9: Midterm Exam\nweek 10: Transient Conduction\nweek 11: The Convection Boundary Layers\nweek 12: External and Internal Flow\nweek 13: Free Convection\nweek 14: Boiling and Condensation\nweek 15: Heat Exchanger\nweek 16: Heat Exchanger\nweek 17: Stefan–Boltzmann Law\nweek 18: Final Exam","scorePolicy":"Quiz 40% \nMidterm exam 30%\nFinnal exam 30%","materials":"課本：Fundamentals of heat and mass transfer. 7th ed., 2011, Bergman, Theodore L., and Frank P.
