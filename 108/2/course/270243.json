To maintain data integrity and fault tolerance, it is necessary to repair failed nodes in networked distributed storage. This course gives an introduction to coding techniques for repairability in networked distributed storage. This course includes a review of knowledge of error-correcting codes, and then examines the traditional erasure codes for networked distributed storage, code design for repairability, network codes on codes, codes on codes, locally repairable codes, and other relevant topics for repairability in networked distributed storage.","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction\nWeek 2: Networked Distributed Storage Systems\nWeek 3 &amp; 4: Coding Preliminaries\nWeek 5:&amp; 6: Erasure Codes for Networked Distributed Storage Systems\nWeek 7 &amp; 8: Code Design for Repairability\nWeek 9: Midterm Exam\nWeek 10 &amp; 11: Network Codes on Codes\nWeek 12 &amp; 13: Codes on Codes\nWeek 14 &amp; 15: Locally Repairable Codes\nWeek 16: Final Exam\nWeek 17 &amp; 18: Paper Study\n\nThe course schedule is subject to change on the basis of class progress.","scorePolicy":"Midterm Exam: 25% \nFinal Exam: 25%\nRegular Grade (Attendance+Quizzes): 25%\nPaper Study and Report: 25%\n\nThe grading policy is subject to change.","materials":"Textbook:\nF.
