It will be mostly conducted in English. Along with the teacher’s lectures, all students will be requested to participate in all kinds of classroom discussions. They also have to apply what they have learned in the course to make two (or three) formal oral presentations based on certain topics. \n\nAs this course will be mostly conducted in English and all students have to participate in various forms of oral communications, all participates are expected to reach certain level of fluency in oral expression as well as certain level of listening comprehension. (A TOEIC score of 550, or more, might be needed.)\n\nLastly, for those who plan to take this course, it is advisable to take the essay writing course first as much academic knowledge in that course is closely related to this one and can therefore greatly help you to better absorb what we are going to learn in this course.\n(If you are interested in taking this course, be sure to attend the first class to know all requirements and regulations in detail. If you cannot do so, it is advisable not to take the course.)","schedule":"Week 1--Introduction\nWeek 2\nWeek 3\nWeek 4\nWeek 5\nWeek 6\nWeek 7\nWeek 8\nWeek 9\nWeek 10\nWeek 11\nWeek 12\nWeek 13\nWeek 14\nWeek 15\nWeek 16\nWeek 17\nWeek 18--Final Exam","scorePolicy":"1. attendance and assignments: 30%\n2. classroom discussions and performances 30%\n3. oral presentations: 40%","materials":"1.
