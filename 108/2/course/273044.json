It covers evaluation methodology for supporting interaction design for products, systems, software applications, toys, games, and specialized appliances intended to be used by children. This field contains a substantial body of knowledge with regard to interaction design and the more narrowly scoped field of usability engineering (UE). Within these areas of practice, and the related research field of HCI, a host of methods are available for evaluating interactive products for children. This course provides an overview of a new and vibrant research field and exposes gaps in current methodologies that future research must address. We also hope it conveys our enthusiasm for this research area, where so much interesting work is taking place and so much still needs to be done.\n\nEvaluating Children's Interactive Products directly addresses the need to ensure that interactive products designed for children — whether toys, games, educational products, or websites — are safe, effective, and entertaining. It presents an essential background in child development and child psychology, particularly as they relate to technology; captures best practices for observing and surveying children, training evaluators, and capturing the child user experience using audio and visual technology; and examines ethical and legal issues involved in working with children and offers guidelines for effective risk management.\n1.　　Presents an essential background in child development and child psychology, particularly as they relate to technology.\n\n2.　　Captures best practices for observing and surveying children, training evaluators, and capturing the child user experience using audio and visual technology.","schedule":"Week 1　　What is a child?\nWeek 2　　What is the TEEACH?\nWeek 3　　What is the Tangible user interface?\nWeek 4　　What is the Role playing game?\nWeek 5　　Workshop 1 (用電腦說故事)\nBlackout Poetry with Makey Makey and Scratch\nWeek 6　　Workshop 2 (競速賽車)\nSTEAM Challenge racing game\nWeek 7　　Workshop 3 (偶像博物館)\nBiography Bottles With Makey Makey\nWeek 8　　Workshop 4 (Makey Makey專題發想與原型製作)\nProject Based Learning\nWeek 9　　What is Computational Thinking concept?\nWeek 10　　What is ABA method you can use for children evaluate?\nWeek 11　　Workshop 5 (栩栩如生的畫)\nLight Up an LED＆code a blink\nWeek 12　　Workshop 6 (紙上開關的四種變形)\nCode a switch\nWeek 13　　Workshop 7 (多工、數位類比與除錯)\nPaper Switch Gallery &amp; Fading Lights In and Out\nWeek 14　　Workshop 8 (Chibitronics專題發想與原型製作)\nProject Based Learning\nWeek 15　　Projects-based evaluation and discussion\nWeek 16　　Projects-based evaluation and discussion\nWeek 17　　Projects Presentation and demo\nWeek 18　　Projects Presentation and demo","scorePolicy":"Assignment (30%) Discussion (20%) Project Design (30) Presentation (15%) Attend (15%)","materials":"1.　　Markopoulos, P., Read, J.
