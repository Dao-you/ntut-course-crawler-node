About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design. Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley. p. 610.) In other words, it is to use digital technologies to create new ways of “interaction” to make a better living for human. As a result, a successful first step of interaction design lies on how to identify the new needs of interaction and then follow by how to design those interactions.\nThis studio project is therefore divided into two phases by asking interacting “what”? and then “how” to interact. You will be asked to develop a problem proposal that illustrates the new behavioral pattern from your study by the midterm; and propose a solution with techniques of interaction design of your choice to conclude this term project.","schedule":"Pattern Language: A Pattern Language is a classic book authored by Christopher Alexander, published in 1977. It details 253 different human behavioral patterns relate to different scales of built environment along with a design suggestion to accommodate those observed patterns. In this explorational phase, we will go out to examine whether if those observed patterns remain unchanged 30 years later, and what are the new emerged patterns that require design attention?\n\nThe Design of Everyday Things: Donald Norman introduces user-centered design in this book, he applied the concept of affordance proposed by J.J Gibson into the field of design. You are encouraged to read this book and understand the essence of user-centered design to help to frame the design solution for the problem you identified through human pattern studies.\n\nWeek 01 Introduction\nWeek04 Pattern Language Field trip\nWeek05 Service Design &amp; Interactive Technologies\nWeek06 HCI\nWeek09 Midterm Review\nWeek18 Show &amp; Tell","scorePolicy":"Interaction Design:\nThere are many emerging design fields relates to interaction design, such as UI, UX, Service Design, Tangible Interaction, AR, VR, Smart Environment and so on so forth.
