The focus will be primarily on statistical analysis. This course unit is suitable for students in any sub-field where quantitative research skills are used. By the end of the semester, I want you to be informed consumers of statistics — able to understand and assess the quality of statistical methods in the papers you read, and to use those methods in your own research. These skills are also highly transferable, and will serve you well in a wide variety of careers. Because we are focusing on fundamentals, we will not have time to discuss more advanced statistical techniques. However, you should leave this class with a solid foundation on which to base further education in these topics.","schedule":"Week　　Tutorial\n1(02/17)　　Overview and introduction\n2(02/24)　　Paper reading and discussion (p1 &amp; p2)\n3(03/02)　　Regression 1\n4(03/09)　　Regression 2\n5(03/16)　　Regression 3\n6(03/23)　　A case study using multiple regression\n7(03/30)　　Report presentation\n8(04/06) 　　Report presentation\n9(04/13)　　Paper reading and discussion\n10(04/20)　　Logistic regression 1\n11(04/27)　　Logistic regression 1\n12(05/04)　　A case study using logistic regression\n13(05/11)　　Report presentation\n14(05/18)　　Report presentation\n15(05/25)　　Paper reading and discussion\n16(06/01)　　Classification and regression tree\n17(06/08)　　Report presentation\n18(06/15)　　Report presentation","scorePolicy":"Homework  (15%)\nQuiz  (10%)\nRecitation  (15%)\nResearch report  (60%)","materials":"Statistical methods for the social sciences, 5th, by Alan Agresti, Barbara Finlay, Published 2018 by Prentice Hall in Upper Saddle River, N.J .","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
