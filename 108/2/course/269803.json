The course objectives include: 1.) A calculus based survey course of basic physics principles. 2.) Resolve a system of forces as they relate to the dynamics of motion. 3.) Explain Newton’s Laws of Motion and apply them in the analyses of problems. 4.) Apply the principles of motion and conduct controlled experiments. 5.) Solve problems and demonstrate the application of the scientific method.","schedule":"2.　　Rotation of a rigid body.\n3.　　Angular momentum and statics.\n4.　　Gravitation.\n5.　　Solids and fluids.\nA.　　Density.\nB.　　Pressure.\nC.　　Continuity equation.\nD.　　Bernoulli’s equation.\n6.　　Oscillations.\nA.　　Simple harmonic oscillation.\nB.　　Energy in simple harmonic motion.\n7.　　Mechanical waves.\nA.　　Speed of a pulse on a string.\nB.　　Reflection and transmission.\nC.　　The wave equation.\n8.　　Sound.\nA.　　The nature of a sound wave.\nB.　　The Doppler Effect.","scorePolicy":"70% quizzes, 30% final exam","materials":"Serway, R.A., Jewett, J.W., Tsai, S.-f., Principles of Physics – A calculus approach, Volume 1, 2nd edition, Cengage, 2017.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":true}]
