Photovoltaic cells which also known as solar cells composed of organic and inorganic materials and electrolytes are the great example for the photoelectrochemical reactions. Here the proposed course is constructed to introduce and implement the basic photoelectrochemical principles, measurements, photoelectrocatalysis, photoelectrical charge transfer and the storage of chemical energy. Further the remaining section of this course will be focused on the detailed studies about the development of different inorganic, organic materials for the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells.","schedule":"第二~六週:報告&amp;Report Experimental Proposal\n第六~十二周:報告&amp; Q&amp;A\n第十三週~十七週:報告&amp;Report Experimental Result","scorePolicy":"報告80%\n出席10%\n發問10%","materials":"網路期刊","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
