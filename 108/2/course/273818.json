The coverage of this graduate-level course is wider than the undergraduate-level course \"Data Structures\" and \"Computer Algorithms\", and includes the discussion of computation models, computation theories, and discrete mathematics techniques that assist the complexity analysis of data structures and algorithms. Advanced data structures and algorithms are covered; in addition, data structures and algorithms for novel computer hardware architecture (such as nonvolatile memories, distributed systems, and quantum computers) are also presented.","schedule":"(Tentative!)\n1.
