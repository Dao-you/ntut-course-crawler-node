The main purpose of this course is providing knowledge of power electronics technologies for offshore wind farms. In order to transfer the wind power energy to the grid, an ac-dc converter integrated with a dc-ac inverter is necessary. The front-end ac-dc converter will convert the variable ac voltage to dc voltage while the dc-ac inverter will connect to the grid as well as convert the dc voltage to constant frequency ac voltage. Main topics of this course will be: (1) Introduction of this course, (2) Introduction of power conversion devices and energy storage systems, (3) Dc-dc power conversion technologies and devices, (4) Ac-dc power conversion technologies and devices, (5) Specifications and technologies of the energy storage system, (6) Introduction of the dc-ac inverter, (7) Circuit topologies of the dc-ac inverter, (8) Control","schedule":"Week 1 : Introduction of this course\nWeek 2-3 : Introduction of power conversion devices and energy storage systems\nWeek 4-5 : Dc-dc power conversion technologies and devices\nWeek 6-7 : Ac-dc power conversion technologies and devices\nWeek 8 : Specifications and technologies of the energy storage system\nWeek 9 : Midterm exam\nWeek 10-11: Circuit topologies of the dc-ac inverter and control strategies of the dc- \n                      ac inverter\nWeek 12-13 :Digital signal processing of the dc-ac inverter and power devices of the \n                     dc-ac inverter,\nWeek 14-15 : Dc-link voltage control strategies and grid-connected low-voltage ride- \n                      through technologies of the dc-ac inverter.\nWeek 16-17 : Verbal report\nWeek 18 : Final exam","scorePolicy":"Attendance rate: 10%\nHomework &amp; Quizzes: 15%\nMidterm exam: 25%\nFinal exam: 25%\nVerbal Report: 25%","materials":"Lecture notes","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
