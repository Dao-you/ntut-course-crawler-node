Matlab/Simulink software is used as the simulation tools. In the beginning classes, DC machine controls are studied. Then, various simulation projects for the control of permanent magnetic synchronous machines (PMSM) are studied. These topics include: controller design, estimators, digital control, pulse width modulation (PWM), and direct torque control. In each lab, theoretical background is introduced first, then followed by a simulation project.","schedule":"1. Introduction of Matlab/Simulink, DC Motor model, current control (lab1)\n2.
