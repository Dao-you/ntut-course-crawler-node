Theories and studies of CALL (computer-assisted language learning), TELL (technology-enhanced language learning), CMC (computer-mediated communication), and online learning will be discussed to understand the utilization of electronic courseware in assisting English learning. Assessment, evaluation, and testing measurements in responding to electronic courseware and to learner characteristics will also be discussed.","schedule":"Week　　Topic\n1　　Introduction to CALL, TELL, CMC\n\n2　　History of CALL and ELT\n3　　CALL and SLA Theories \n4　　CALL and Multimedia\n5　　CALL and Distance Learning \n6　　Evaluation of Coursewares\n7　　Coursewares Showcase \n8　　CALL and Culture\nTelecollaboration \n9　　CALL and Listening\n10　　CALL and Speaking\n11　　CALL and Reading\n12　　CALL and Writing\n13　　CALL and Assessment\n14　　Mobile-based Language Learning\n15　　Digital Game-based Language Learning\n16　　CALL and VR, AR, MR\n17　　Activity Design Presentation \n18　　Final Project Presentation","scorePolicy":"A total of 100 points will be granted.
