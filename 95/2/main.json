The second part of the course introduces various surface analysis methods, including vacuum technology, Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),"},"id":"95443","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"二化三","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=2&code=929","code":"929"}],"teacher":[{"name":"黃玲媛","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=2&code=10300","code":"10300"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["7","8"],"tue":["9"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"【停開】","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3203068","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1404002","name":{"zh":"當代思潮與國家發展","en":"Contemporary Thoughts And National Development"},"description":{"zh":"在二十世紀眾多分歧的思想中，有些廣受人們的認同，並信奉為價值體系而實踐，此稱為思潮。這些流行的思潮，影響人民生活，社會生計，更影響著國家的發展方向。因此，這些思潮與國家發展有極為密切的關係。思潮的內容及其與國家發展的關係就是本課程的主要內容。當代思潮中，民族主義、國家主義與世界主義的理想不同，國家之運作便不相同；民主主義、共產主義影響各國的政治制度及人民的生活方式；資本主義、社會主義與共產主義關係著國計民生，在經濟、社會及生活各層面都深受其影響。本課程中第一部分介紹最具代表性的當代思潮，第二部份就民族思潮、經濟思潮與國家發展的關係加以剖析，藉以探討我國立國的精神所在，即民族平等、政治民主，經濟發展，以實現三民主義自由、民主、均富理想。","en":"In the 21th century, there are numerous different thoughts in which some are well recognized, treasured and put in practice.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

Engineering ethics is attracting increasing interest among colleges of engineering and universities throughout the well-developed high-tech countries. The increasing concern for the ethic and value dimensions of engineering is, at least in part, a result of the attention that the media has given to cases such as the Challenger disaster of the NASA, the public safety of poor infrastructure, the collapse of buildings in the 921 earthquake, and the environmental pollution due to oil spill. As a response to this concern, a new discipline, engineering ethics, is emerging for undergraduate engineering courses.
