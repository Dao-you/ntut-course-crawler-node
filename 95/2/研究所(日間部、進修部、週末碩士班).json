In these projects, the students work alone or in groups. The projects are usually based on problems defined within different branches of industry and social sectors. Project work is usually done under realistic conditions, in collaboration with different industrial companies or public institutions. Students can contribute to this reality by developing sensible and usable products and systems which include qualities that speak to the heart and mind of people. We educate students as designers to have an open mind on both conceptual ideas and detailed realistic design solutions in order to develop higher quality products.
