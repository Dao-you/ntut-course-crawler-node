The task of decision making entails choosing between various alternatives. This choice is governed by our desire to make the \"best\" decision.

Optimization theory and methods deal with selecting the best alternative in the sense of the given objective function. The purpose of this course is to provide a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods. To accomplish this goal, we include many examples that illustrate the theory and algorithms discussed in the class.

Also, in the field of geotechnical engineering, engineers tended to apply very conservative safety factors due to the uncertain nature of the geological materials.  As a result, the selection of the proper design numbers was not objective or accurate.  To address this problem, it is the goal of this course to introduce the concept of probability so that students could become familiar with statistical concepts such as normal distribution, time sequence analysis, regression analysis, and their applications in the measurements of geological data."},"id":"100421","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"防災所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=963","code":"963"}],"teacher":[{"name":"陳偉堯","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=10918","code":"10918"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["2","3","4"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"土木3F","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=261","code":"261"}],"people":"18","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=4236086","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"3604052","name":{"zh":"計算機網路","en":"Computer Networks"},"description":{"zh":"1.電腦網路概述2.階層結構3.路由與交換4.流量與擁塞控制5.媒體存取控制6.區域網路協定與標準７．網路互連８．效能評估","en":"1.Introduction to Computer Network2.Layered Structure3.Routing and Switching 4.Flow and Congestion Control5.Medium Access Control 6.Local Area Network Protocols and Standards7.Network Interconnection8.Performance Analysis"},"id":"100426","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"四子四甲","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=664","code":"664"},{"name":"四子四乙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=665","code":"665"},{"name":"二子四","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=837","code":"837"}],"teacher":[{"name":"李仁貴","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=11070","code":"11070"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["8","9"],"wed":[],"thu":["4"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"二教306(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=31","code":"31"}],"people":"43","peopleWithdraw":"3","ta":[{"name":"謝冠宇         ","link":"ShowTA.jsp?code=100426&ta=94418002  ","code":"100426&ta=94418002  "}],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3604052","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"3604064","name":{"zh":"數位影像處理","en":"Digital Image Processing"},"description":{"zh":"1.簡介，2.數位影像處理的基礎，3.影像的轉換，4.影像的增強， 5.影像的復原，6.影像的壓縮，7.影像分割，8.影像的表達及描述，9. 自動車導航，及醫學影像的處理和應用，10.論文討論。","en":"1.Introduction 2.Principles of digital image processing3.Image transformation 4.Image enhancement5.Image reconstruction6.Image compreession 7.Image partition 8.Image description9.Applications 10.Papers study"},"id":"100427","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"四子四甲","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=664","code":"664"},{"name":"四子四乙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=665","code":"665"},{"name":"二子四","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=837","code":"837"}],"teacher":[{"name":"駱榮欽","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=10497","code":"10497"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["2"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":["1","2"],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"綜科409","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=103","code":"103"}],"people":"41","peopleWithdraw":"3","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3604064","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=100427&code=10497"]},{"code":"3602060","name":{"zh":"雷射與光電實習","en":"Laser and Electro-Optical Lab."},"description":{"zh":"本課程配合雷射與光電工程課程，期使光電課程能完整的包括理論與實務部份。內容包括：１.光電實驗簡介２.光的反射與折射３.光的成像４.光的偏極化５.光的干涉與繞射６.光功率計７.雷射特性量測８.光纖特性研究９.光纖ＮＡ測量１０.光纖Ｌｏｓｓ測量１１.光纖之連接１２.光纖訊系統１３.專題","en":"Course content 1.Introduction 2.Reflection and Refraction 3.Imaging 4.Ploariztion 5.Interference and Dissraction6.optical power Meter7.Laser characteistic 8.Fiber End preparation 9.Fiber NA 10.Fiber Loss 11.Fiber connector 12.Fiber optic communication 13.apecial Topics"},"id":"100429","stage":"1","credit":"1.0","hours":"3","courseType":"▲","class":[{"name":"四子二甲","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=852","code":"852"}],"teacher":[{"name":"耿繼業","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=10456","code":"10456"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["2","3","4"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"綜科602","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=294","code":"294"}],"people":"25","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3602060","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"3603069","name":{"zh":"線性系統","en":"Linear Systems"},"description":{"zh":"1.信號與系統緒論，2.連續時間性系統的分析，3.連續時間性系統狀態變數分析，4.連續時間性系統信號的傅立葉分析，5.
