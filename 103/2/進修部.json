Part Three then deals with risk management issues from a VaR perspective, including 1) decision-making rules, such as investment and hedging rules; 2) credit risks; 3) liquidity, operational and legal risks; 4) capital allocation; 5) firm-wide risk management."},"id":"201870","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"職經管所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=2&code=1897","code":"1897"}],"teacher":[{"name":"吳斯偉","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=2&code=11429","code":"11429"},{"name":"張守為","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=2&code=23624","code":"23624"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":["A","B","C"],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"科研大樓734","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=2&code=487","code":"487"}],"people":"18","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5705346","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=201870&code=11429"]},{"code":"5705447","name":{"zh":"客戶關係管理","en":"Customer Relationship Management"},"description":{"zh":"建立學生對各類顧客關係管理相關議題之基礎理論架構觀念，奠定學生日後從事顧客關係管理分析研究工作時之需。課程中將以個案實例為主，並配合各種資料探勘套裝軟體，以應用的觀點使學生更容易接受了解線上分析、資料倉儲與資料探勘分析的功用。","en":"This course includes the fundamental theory of data mining techniques and the various applications in different enterprises.
