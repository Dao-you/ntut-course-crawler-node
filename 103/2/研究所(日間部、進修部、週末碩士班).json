The target is to investigate how a cultural/literary text is created in relation to, and in response to, another text in different media/genres, and how this \"chain reaction\" or \"web of influences\" displays a rippling effect that travels across the boundaries among painting, music, architecture, literature, and film.  For example, Vermeer's painting entitled \"The Girl with a Pearl Earring\" inspires the creation of a novel by Tracy Chevalier, which in turn facilitates the creation of a movie also with the same title. The case is the same with the musical piece of \"Gloomy Sunday\" which inspires the creation of many verbal/visual/audio art forms under the same title and even makes a social impact on increasing suicide cases.
