Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. As people often observe, Shakespeare may trigger our imagination with his language and promote effective communication in every aspect of our life, including that of our careers.

Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen."},"id":"195366","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四電二丙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=2&code=1706","code":"1706"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["3","4"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--哲學(二)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419983","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1419985","name":{"zh":"博雅核心課程-社會","en":"Core Curriculum of Liberal Arts Education：Society"},"description":{"zh":"為了培養學生有關社會、經濟與管理的基礎知識，特規劃了相關的核心課程，增進學生對個人與社會的認知，及對社會整體的分析與瞭解能力,進而?化社會適應能力。","en":"To develop the basic knowledge of society, economic and management to our students, improve them the cognition of individual and society, and the abilities of analysis and understanding, then enhance the social adjustment ability."},"id":"195367","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四電二丙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=2&code=1706","code":"1706"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["1","2"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅核心--社會(一)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419985","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"1419993","name":{"zh":"博雅選修課程","en":"Elective Curriculum of Liberal Arts Education"},"description":{"zh":"為了訓練學生獨立思考與判斷能力，培養健全人格，提升人文涵養，延續通識教育六大向度的核心課程，在各向度均規劃了一系列的博雅選修課程，提供學生更多的選擇，以建立學生開闊的視野及達成全人教育的精神。","en":"To train students have the abilities of independent thinking and judgment, develop the healthy personality and Humanities conservation, and keep the six fields of core curriculum in general education. this course will design a series of optional curriculum on Erudition & Refinement in each field, and develop students the broader sight and reach the spirit of the holistic education."},"id":"195368","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四電二丙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=2&code=1706","code":"1706"}],"teacher":[],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["5","6"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"0","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"請選博雅選修(三)","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1419993","syllabusLinks":[]},{"code":"3102041","name":{"zh":"微處理機","en":"Microprocessor"},"description":{"zh":"(1)電腦數字系統 (2)8088系列組合語言 (3)8088系統接線、時序、及故障排除 (4)8088中斷及中斷應用 (5)數位介面 (6)各種記憶體 (7)DMA資料傳輸。","en":"Course Title:MicroprocessorDescription:This course introduces the working principles of computer.It puts emphasis on both hardware and software, as well as both theoryand appplication.

The key model for soft computing is the human mind or biological systems.  The guiding principle of soft computing includes: Exploit the tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost. The basic ideas underlying soft computing in its current incarnation have links to many earlier influences, among them Zadeh's 1965 paper on fuzzy sets; the 1973 paper on the analysis of complex systems and decision processes; and the 1979 report (1981 paper) on possibility theory and soft data analysis. The inclusion of neural computing and genetic computing in soft computing came at a later point. The main focus of this course will be in Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolutionary Programming/Evolutionary Strategy (EP/ES).

從事哲學思考，就是對上述問題，進行一種反省。 這種反省，能夠讓我們明白形成這些問題背後的一些基本原則，以及解決這些問題的一些可能方案的理由根據和獲致這些解決方案的應有程序。 由於哲學是著重思考與反省的活動，學習哲學其實不僅僅可以幫助我們掌握和人類自身與生活世界相關問題的一些根本知識，更能培養一個負責任的社會公民不可或缺的一種思維能力和反省態度。","en":"Philosophy is not only a fundamental subject with both ideals and practical value, but also an interesting thinking activity of depth.  The topics it discusses concern some basic questions for we human beings and the world around us.  These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death.  Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more
