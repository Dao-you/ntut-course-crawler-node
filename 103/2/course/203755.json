Everybody knows the stories even though the stories are very old, or rather everybody knows them because they are very old.  This course introduces students to central thematic and cultural ideas in the major writers of the early modern period, Chaucer and Shakespeare.  Read closely by the major writers of later periods, these works are the foundation of modern English literature and western thought.  They also provide essential background knowledge for any graduate study of western culture in general.","schedule":"Week 　　1: 　　Introduction\n\n2-6: 　　Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales \n(The General Prologue, The Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale, The Franklin’s Tale)\n\n6-11: 　　Shakespeare, Hamlet\n\n11-15:  Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet\n\n　　16-17: Adaptations\n\n　　18:　　Final week","scorePolicy":"Grades:\nMidterm 33.3%\nFinal 33.3%\nClass Work/Weekly Participation 33.3%\n\nAttendance: a combination of 4 absences or late days = -10 points from course grade","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
