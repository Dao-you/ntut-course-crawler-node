It also highlights the close relationship between course design and teaching as the teacher builds on knowledge. Students will present and discuss the viewpoints of various classroom teachers and researchers in both ESL and EFL contexts. They, therefore, are expected to finish the assigned readings before class and actively participate in class presentations and discussions.","schedule":"Week 1     No Class!\nWeek 2     Course Introduction\nWeek 3     Chapter 1\nWeek 4     Chapter 2\nWeek 5     Chapter 3\nWeek 6     Chapter 4 (Part I)\nWeek 7     No Class!\nWeek 8     Chapter 4 (Part II)\nWeek 9     Chapter 5 (Parts I &amp; II)\nWeek 10    Midterm Project Due\nWeek 11    Chapter 6 (Part I)\nWeek 12    Chapter 6 (Part II)\nWeek 13    Chapter 7\nWeek 14    Chapter 8 (Part I)\nWeek 15    Chapter 8 (Part II)\nWeek 16    Chapter 10\nWeek 17    Chapter 9\nWeek 18    Final Project Due","scorePolicy":"Class Participation: 40%\nMidterm Project: 30%\nFinal Project: 30%","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
