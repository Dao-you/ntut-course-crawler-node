Britain, and France) imagines the East (Persia, China, India, Vietnam, Japan) or, to put it differently, the way in which the West represents the East to itself, and thus the course is as much a course in cultural miscommunication as it is in cultural communication.  The course will be a study in reality, illusion, fantasy, stereotype, desire, deconstruction, globalism, deconstruction, and ideology, among other topics.","schedule":"Wk 1: Introduction\n\nWk 2: 300 [2007]\nWk 3: Lecture on 300: Ideology\n\nWk 4: Black Narcissus [1947]\nWk 5: Lecture on Black Narcissus: Desire\n\nWk 6: Keys to the Kingdom [1944]\nWk 7: Lecture on Keys to the Kingdom: Religion, Stereotype, Cliche\n\nWk 8: MID-TERM 40%\n\nWk 9: M Butterfly [1993]\nWk 10: Lecture on M Butterfly: Deconstruction\n\nWk 11: Memoirs of a Geisha [2005]\nWk 12: Lecture on Memoirs of a Geisha: “Woman does not exist”\n\nWk 13: L’Amant [The Lover] [1992]\nWk 14: Lecture on L’Amant: Cross Cultural Love, Feminism, and Destruction\n\nWk 15: The Fly [1986]\nWk 16: Lecture on The Fly: Globalism\n\nWk 17: Reading “China” from Hegel’s Philosophy of History; Excerpts from Barthes’s Empire of Signs\n \nWk 18: FINAL EXAM 60%","scorePolicy":"Text: Photocopied lectures.\nEvaluation: Mid-Term Exam 40 %.
