Yet it has nonetheless endured as a popular form into the 21st century.  Evolving since the Middle Ages to become less a genre in its own right than a transcendent mode of writing and of thought which invades, combines, and reshapes the other traditional genres, romance's protean nature has made it an omnipresent and influential force in modern Western culture.  This course will trace the development of romance as a genre and as a philosophical and interpretive mode from the Middle Ages to the present, as we ask how it has changed and why it has persisted throughout Western history, becoming essential to our understanding of thought and of character in the modern West."},"id":"193578","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"英文所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=1&code=1861","code":"1861"}],"teacher":[{"name":"施欣文","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=11589","code":"11589"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["5","6","7"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"共同301_2","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=478","code":"478"}],"people":"10","peopleWithdraw":"1","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5425503","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=193578&code=11589"]},{"code":"5425604","name":{"zh":"文學與批判理論應用專題","en":"Special Topic in Literary and Critical Theory"},"description":{"zh":"課程旨在以跨領域的思考方法，融合文學與批判理論，探討特定主題如何在作品中呈現，思考在不同文化背景和歷史脈絡中的意義，以訓練學生運用和整合在其他學科，甚至其他學術領域學到的能力：諸如藝術和文學風格，社會和哲學思潮等。透過對文本（文學、電影、和其他藝術領域）的細讀和理論的思考和運用，學生可進一步應用跨領域專題研究的方法。可能的專題包括：文學與復仇文化、文學與音樂、電影中的愛與慾、文學與哲學等。","en":"This course focuses on a chosen theme in literary and cultural studies, aiming to train our graduate's ability to investigate, both textually and theoretically, a theme in cultural productions in a comparative mode.

Such data cannot be interpreted without detailed observations of the field relationships between collected samples and of the geology of areas in which measurements were made.Professer Tucker had said that \"The study of field geology is often an exciting and rewarding occupation. However, to get the most out of these rocks, it is necessary to undertake precise and accurate fieldwork. The secret of successful fieldwork is a keen eye for detail and an enquiring mind. Be observant, see everything in the outcrop, then think about the things seen and look again.\"This course is designed as advanced training to field observation, description and geologic mapping for graduate student"},"id":"194020","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"資源所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=1&code=1872","code":"1872"}],"teacher":[{"name":"羅偉","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=11170","code":"11170"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":["6","8","9"],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"光華館401","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=507","code":"507"}],"people":"14","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=7925150","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=194020&code=11170"]},{"code":"7925155","name":{"zh":"基礎資源工程","en":"Fundamentals of Mineral Resources Engineering"},"description":{"zh":"資源工程導論為資源工程的入門學科，其範圍包括天然的金屬、非金屬、礦物與石油、天然氣、建築用砂石、石材與水等原生資源，以及工商業及一般生活的廢棄物或其附帶產生的可再生資源。期對初學者有一整體的基本概念。","en":"This is a general introduction class to provide student basic knowledge about resources engineering which include metal, nonmetal, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, aggregates, dimension stone and water resources."},"id":"194022","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"資源所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=1&code=1872","code":"1872"}],"teacher":[{"name":"王玉瑞","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=10221","code":"10221"},{"name":"翁祖炘","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=10470","code":"10470"},{"name":"蔡子萱","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=11424","code":"11424"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["8","9","A"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[],"people":"10","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=7925155","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=194022&code=10221","ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=194022&code=11424"]},{"code":"7925156","name":{"zh":"高等工程統計學","en":"Advanced Engineering Statistics"},"description":{"zh":"1.機率簡介 2.機率分佈 3.統計概論 4.抽樣分析 5.參數估計 6.區間估計 7.假設檢定 8.迴歸分佈 9.統計品管 10.變異分析","en":"Introduction to probability Probability distribution Introduction to statistics Sampling analysis Quality control"},"id":"194023","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"資源所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=1&code=1872","code":"1872"}],"teacher":[{"name":"王泰典","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=11256","code":"11256"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["A","B","C"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教504(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=61","code":"61"}],"people":"20","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"日間部與職資源所合開","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=7925156","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=194023&code=11256"]},{"code":"3706002","name":{"zh":"高等生產管理","en":"Production Management"},"description":{"zh":"針對大學所習之廣義生產管理再作深入的闡述，一方面做公開的個案分析研討，以收進一步的學習之效，同時要求學生做實務專題研究","en":"Production and operation management,case study and analysis,and independent study."},"id":"194027","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"▲","class":[{"name":"管理外國學生專班","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=103&sem=1&code=1873","code":"1873"}],"teacher":[{"name":"蔡佩芳","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=11435","code":"11435"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["2","3","4"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"六教224(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=103&sem=1&code=422","code":"422"}],"people":"16","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"英語","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3706002","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=194027&code=11435"]},{"code":"9805001","name":{"zh":"管理科學","en":"Management Science"},"description":{"zh":"本課程之目的在探討如何運用科學與系統化的方式解決管理上的問題。整個過程包括：資料蒐集與問題分析、數量模式的建構、問題求解、成本效益分析、系統規劃設計與執行等步驟。課程內容主要以應用案例說明為主，讓同學瞭解理論如何與實際問題結合，也會介紹最佳化計算軟體來求解數學模式並輔助說明所得數據之意涵。","en":"The purpose of this course is talking about how to utilize scientific and systematical approaches to solve management problems.
