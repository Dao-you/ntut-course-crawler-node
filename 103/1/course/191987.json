The course provides a comprehensive treatment of the major aspects of using statistical methodology for quality control and improvement.  Both traditional and modern methods are introduced, including state-of-the-art techniques for statistical process monitoring and control and statistically designed experiments for process characterization, optimization, and process robustness studies. Students will: 1) learn to apply control charts to monitor the quality characteristics of a product or process; 2) learn techniques for assessing how capable a process is of achieving given design specification, and 3) design and analyze experiments for improving a manufacturing process; 4) realize how the modern quality management system works under competing environments.","schedule":"1　　Introduction &amp; Modern Business Environment　　Chapter 1\n2　　Statistical Methods Useful in QC &amp; Improvement　　Chapter 2.1-2.4\n3　　Inferences about Process Quality　　Chapter 3.1-3.3\n4　　Inferences about Process Quality 　　Chapter 3.4-3.5\n5　　Philosophy of Statistical Process Control　　Chapter 4.1-4.3\n6　　Philosophy of Statistical Process Control　　Chapter 4.4-4.7\n7　　Control Charts for Variables 　　Chapter 5.1-5.3\n8　　Control Charts for Variables 　　Chapter 5.4-5.6\n9　　Midterm Exam　　in class\n10　　Review of Midterm Exam　　\n11　　Control Charts for Attributes 　　Chapter 6.1-6.3\n12　　Control Charts for Attributes 　　Chapter 6.4-6.5\n13　　Process &amp; Measurement System　　Chapter 7.1-7.4\n14　　Process and Measurement System 　　Chapter 7.5-7.8\n15　　CUSUM &amp; EWMA Control Charts 　　Chapter 8.1-8.2\n16　　Other Univariate Monitoring Techniques 　　Chapter 9.1-9.4\n17　　Final Exam　　in class","scorePolicy":"Grading Policy: 25% Homework Assignments &amp; Quizzes, 30% Midterm, 30% Final, 15% Group Term Project","materials":"[Textbook]\n\nDouglas C.
