The course objectives include: 1.) A calculus based survey course of basic physics principles. 2.) Resolve a system of forces as they relate to the dynamics of motion. 3.) Explain Newton’s Laws of Motion and apply them in the analyses of problems. 4.) Apply the principles of motion and conduct controlled experiments. 5.) Solve problems and demonstrate the application of the scientific method.","schedule":"1.　　Introduction.\n2.　　Vector.\n       A.　　Coordinate systems.\n       B.　　Vector and scalar quantities.\n3.　　Motion in one dimension.\n       A.　　Position, velocity, and speed.\n       B.　　Acceleration - Derivatives.\n       C.　　Freely falling objectives.\n       D.　　The Momentum equation.\n4.　　Motion in two dimensions.\n       A.　　Two dimensional motion with constant acceleration.\n       B.　　Projectile motion.\n       C.　　Uniform circular motion.\n       D.　　Tangential and radial acceleration.\n5.　　The laws of motion.\n       A.　　The concept of force.\n       B.　　Newton’s first law.\n       C.　　Mass.\n       D.　　Newton’s second law.\n       E.　　The gravitational force and weight.\n       F.　　Newton’s third law.\n       G.　　Some applications of Newton’s Laws.\n6.　　Circular motion and other applications of Newton’s Laws.\n       A.　　Forces of friction\n       B.　　Uniform circular motion\n7.　　Energy of a system.\n       A.　　Work done by a constant force.\n       B.　　Kinetic energy and the work-kinetic energy theorem.\n       C.　　The potential energy.\n       D.　　Conservation of energy.","scorePolicy":"Homework/Quizzes: 20% (遲交/缺席者以零分計算)\nMidterm　　　　: 30% (缺席者以零分計算)\nFinal Exam    　　: 30% (缺席者以零分計算)\nAttendance   　　: 10% (缺席一次扣2％, 遲到15分鐘當缺席，以網路記錄為準)\nParticipation　　:  10%（學習狀態：上課表現、學期間至少前見我二次）","materials":"Harris Benson (2013).
