The purpose of this course is to learn the concepts and physical principles of water flow as well as the techniques that can be used to solve hydrologic problems. Thus, one of the goals of this course is to give you a balanced view of hydrology - one that includes a description of the physical processes plus a coherent presentation of the theories and techniques that are used in practice.","schedule":"Specific Elements:\n1.　　Hydrological cycle.\n2.　　Frequency analysis.\n3.　　Precipitation.\n4.　　Losses from precipitation.\n5.　　Hydrograph.\n6.　　Flood routing.\n7.　　Groundwater.\n8.　　Hydrological measurement.","scorePolicy":"25% quizs, 25% midterm exam, 30% final exam, 10% Homework, 10% class participation.","materials":"Viessman, W.J., Lewis, G.L. 2012.
