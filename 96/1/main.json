Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. This course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. This course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. This course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed. Through the internalization, the students might benefit themse"},"id":"103968","stage":"1","credit":"2.0","hours":"2","courseType":"△","class":[{"name":"四資一","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=96&sem=1&code=1057","code":"1057"}],"teacher":[{"name":"楊明璋","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=22462","code":"22462"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["5","6"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"二教204(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=22","code":"22"}],"people":"53","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=1404003","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=103968&code=22462"]},{"code":"1401032","name":{"zh":"微積分","en":"Calculus"},"description":{"zh":"本課程希望在一學年中，能使學生對微分及積分有充分的瞭解、培養邏輯推理、啟發思考創造、強化計算演繹並注重應用與作圖，以建立同學未來學習工程數學及相關專業課程之數學基礎，充分達到學以致用的目的。課程內容包括：1.極限與連續，2.導數及其應用，3.不定積分與定積分，4.超越函數及其反函數，5.積分法則，6.不定型與瑕積分，7.定積分的應用，8.空間幾何與向量微積分，9.偏導數，10.重積分。","en":"This course aims at developing comprehension of Derivation and Integral、activating capabilities of Logic Inference and Induction、enlightening confidence and independence、strengthening calculating abilities with an emphasis on its application and diagram、furnishing a sound basis for future specialty.

It has developed rapidly over the past decade. The reason for the recent advances in structural geology has been the realization that naturally deformed rocks seen in field outcrops contain a fantastic range of small-scale features which relate directly to large-scale orogenic deformation systems. The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course.
