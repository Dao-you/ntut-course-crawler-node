Beautiful or not, alternative forms of art have become increasingly influential in shaping our culture and our daily lives, from television, to pop music, to advertising, to online games.\nStudying films, paintings, music and other forms of pop culture, we will consider the nature and significance of pop culture in the West and in the East.  Among the questions we will ask:  How does pop culture differ from traditional or “high” culture?  What are the standards for evaluating such works?  Is there a difference between good and bad pop culture – can what is popular be good; must what is popular be good?\n","schedule":"Week 1　　9/21　　Introduction\nWeek 2　　9/28　　Monty Python and the Holy Grail\nWeek 3　　10/5　　Student responses:  MP\nX-files: “Pilot” (ep.1)\n\nWeek 4　　10/12　　X-files: “Deep Throat” (ep 2)\nStudent responses: ep. 1\n\nWeek 5　　10/19　　X-files: “Tithonus”\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer ep.1\n\nWeek 6　　10/26　　Student responses: Scully and Buffy\nBuffy ep.2\n\nWeek 7　　11/2　　Anime: taking animation seriously (Ghost in the Shell)\nWeek 8　　11/9　　Anime:  taking animation seriously (Cowboy Bebop)\nWeek 9　　11/16　　Anime discussion:  Ghost and Bebop\nWeek 10　　11/23　　Anime:  self-referentiality (comic party / genshiken)\nMidterm essay due\n\nWeek 11　　11/30　　Ghost World\nWeek 12　　12/7　　Student Responses:  Ghost World\nWeek 13　　12/14　　Student presentations\nWeek 14　　12/21        Student presentations\nWeek 15　　12/28　　Student presentations\nWeek 16　　1/4　　Song Lyrics\nWeek 17　　1/11　　Song Lyrics\nWeek 18　　1/18　　FINAL EXAM\n","scorePolicy":"Midterm  33%\nFinal　　33%\nShort Assignments and Class Presentations/ Participation  33%\n","materials":"Books:\ncourse book\n","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
