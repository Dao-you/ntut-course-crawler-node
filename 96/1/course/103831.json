We will study the fundamental characteristics of dramatic form including plot, character, action, and setting, as well as the conventions of dramatic genres, specifically tragedy, comedy, and tragicomedy.  Our approach will be informed by the examination of drama as a specifically literary genre, studying the texts of the plays for their themes, historical contexts and uses of language. But drama--unlike fiction and poetry--is a mixed genre: the play is only partially realized when read on the page.  It must be performed.  Thus each student will be responsible for bringing about the enactment of short scenes from the ancient and modern dramas we study.","schedule":"STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n1)  Participation.  A substantial portion of your final grade is based on your participation in the class.  This is calculated not only according to your giving of presentations and engagement in debates, but upon your willingness to ask meaningful questions of and critique classmates.\n\n2)  Attendance.  Frequent attendance is mandatory.  After your first three absences, each subsequent unexcused absence will cause your final grade to be reduced by one grade point.  If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out the substance of class discussions and to make up homework.  Since I generally take roll in the first five minutes of class, if you come in late you may be marked absent.  It is your responsibility to let me know if you've been tardy after class ON THE DAY THAT YOU ARE LATE.  Three tardies = one absence.\n","scorePolicy":"25%  midterm\n25%  final\n25%  homework\n25%  participation\n","materials":"Course Handout","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
