Through highlighting the coherent relationships between actions (techniques) and thoughts (principles) in language teaching, it aims at helping students uncover the thoughts that guide their own actions as future language teachers. Students are required to work on group presentations and teaching demonstrations. In doing so, they are expected to further develop their ability to examine each teaching method in a more critical view.","schedule":"Week 1      Introduction\nWeek 2      The Grammar-Translation Method\nWeek 3      The Direct Method\nWeek 4      Teaching Demonstration\nWeek 5      The Audio-Lingual Method\nWeek 6      Teaching Demonstration\nWeek 7      The Silent Way\nWeek 8      Teaching Demonstration\nWeek 9      Midterm\nWeek 10     Desuggestopedia\nWeek 11     Teaching Demonstration\nWeek 12     Community Language Learning\nWeek 13     Teaching Demonstration\nWeek 14     Total Physical Response\nWeek 15     Communicative Language Teaching\nWeek 16     Teaching Demonstration\nWeek 17     Final\nWeek 18     Final","scorePolicy":"Class Attendance………………………………… 10%\nClass Participation………………………………30%\nMidterm………………………………………………30%\nFinal…………………………………………………30%\n","materials":"Larsen-Freeman, D.
