Throughout the course, students learn to develop their writing through dialogic interactions with texts, through class discussion and other collaborative class practices, and through sequenced assignments.  By using a dynamic, dialogic approach, students are exposed to various perspectives and guided to think critically and write effectively as they move toward two writing projects on self-exploration (“Stories from My Life” and “Going to College”).","schedule":"Weekly Schedule\n  \nDate　　Key Topic　　R        Reading　　\n9/19　　Introduction　　Misconceptions about Writing　　\n9/26　　Observing　　Flower(11-3); Nike (handout)　　\n10/3　　Free Association or Writing from a List &amp; “My Name”(24)\n        “to gloria, who is she”(25-6)　　\n10/10　　Holiday　　　　\n10/17　　Being specific　　“The Match” by Fred Cox (handout)　　“Stories from my Life\n10/24　　Dialogue with a Tex “Beauty: When the Other...”(39-44　　\n10/31　　Point of View　　     “　　Writing Through Acting\n11/7　　Developing your Writing　　“I Remember” (47-52)　　\n11/14　　Moving toward  Significance　　“Fish Cheeks” (66-7);\n        “Annie John” (61-3)　　\n11/21　　Getting an Outside Review　　“My Daughter Smokes” (73-75)　　“Stories from my Life” \n11/28　　Reading &amp; Reflecting on “Going to College”　　\n        “Going to College” by Jane Ellen Wilson (104-11)\n12/5　　Note making &amp; Note taking　　“Going to College” \n         by Karen Wong (113-4)　　\n12/12    College is a Waste of Time and Money” by Caroline Bird\n         (114-22)　　\n12/19　　Making Connections　　“Letters to the Editor” (123-7)　　\n12/26　　Critical Thinking　　“The Price of Learning” (133-4);\n        “Only Daughter” (151-4)　　\n1/2　　Making Additions &amp; Clarification”　　“Going to College”\n         (167-8; 173-5; 176-8; 178-81)　　\n1/9　　Organization &amp; Clarity　　 \n1/16　　Comments and Discussion　　　　\n\n","scorePolicy":"1.　　Midterm Project: 20%\n2.　　Final Project: 30%\n3.　　In-class writing and Practices: 30%\n4.　　Peer-reviewing and Comments: 10%\n5.　　Attendance and Class Participation: 10%\n","materials":"Pamela Gay.
