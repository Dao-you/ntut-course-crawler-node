Students will read and discuss primary and secondary sources from Eastern and Western wisdom traditions and compose four short (1-3 page) papers and one medium length (4-5 page) essay based on these works.  Today, the first day of class, you will select a primary text from those I have available.  Your research topic for this semester will be derived from this original source, but it will be your responsibility to find more research materials--books, articles, films, interviews, musical compositions, poems, stories: anything that can be documented-- on your topic.  It will also be up to you to find an angle on your material: perhaps it will be a study of the culture, mythology, religion, or lifestyle from which your original source is drawn. Perhaps it will be a comparative work—examining creation, deluge or resurrection stories from more than one culture.  Perhaps it will be an examination of music, art or literature contemporaneous with your source text or—in a manner which sheds light on your primary source, or your primary source sheds light on it--from our own time.  As long as your final result includes the first text you selected in some significant manner, you will have accomplished the task I am assigning.","schedule":"COURSE SCHEDULE\n\nAll assignments are due next class session unless otherwise indicated.

A significant portion of the class will be given over to peer evaluation of essays.  The purpose of this is at least threefold:  1) to offer student writers criticism from peers, so that they may improve their work; 2) to cause each class member to articulate his or her critical concerns; and 3) to encourage the formation of a community of writers.  For peer evaluation you must be prepared to make multiple copies of your written work for other students in the class, AND YOU MUST BRING YOUR WORK AND THREE COPIES IN TO CLASS ON THE DAY THEY ARE DUE.  All peer evaluation activities--not only your having your paper evaluated, but also your active, cheerful participation in the critique of essays by your fellow classmates—are absolutely mandatory and count towards participation points in the class that cannot be made up.\n\n2)  Journals.  Students must keep a journal on an ongoing basis containing responses to the works they are examining and share these writings with the rest of the class.  The essays that you write will be drawn from these journal entries.  To receive full credit, you must bring your journal entry to class and read it aloud on the day that it is due.  I will not accept late or e-mailed journal entries or writing assignments.\n\n3) Presentations.  Students will give two oral presentations in concert with two or three classmates.  Preparation of these presentations will lead to development and refinement of your final essay topic, and will provide a meaningful context for discussion in the class.\n\n4)  Attendance.  Frequent attendance is mandatory.  After your first two absences, each subsequent unexcused absence will cause your final grade to be reduced by one grade point.  If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out the substance of class discussions and to make up homework.  \n\n5)  Anyone caught plagiarizing will receive a failing grade in the course.  All outside sources that you use in the production of your papers must be properly attributed using the MLA format.\n\n25%　　Papers 1-4　　　　　　　　\n25%　　Quizzes and Journals\n25%　　Final Paper　　\n25%　　Participation and Presentation\n\n\nSCHEDULE OF FORMAL (GRADED) WRITING ASSIGNMENTS\n\nWRITING ASSIGNMENT #1: Preliminary Research\n\nYou have been given a text about which you probably know little or nothing.  Now you must take on the role of researcher/detective.  What is this text?  From whence does it come (that is, what was the name of location when it was written, and. if that has changed, what is the name of that location now)?  Who (that is, what individual or group) wrote it?  What is the original language in which it was written?  When was it written?  Why?  What role does it play in the larger cultural tradition from which it derives?  Draw upon outside sources as appropriate, but also upon your own (phenomenological) experience of the text as you have recorded in your journal and the “Definitions of Myth” as articulated by Birrell.  In what sense is your source text an example (or not) of shen-hua?  In what ways does your source text bear out (or not) Doty’s definitive statement on the significance, context and function of myth (Cf. Birrell 4-5)?  Your finished paper should be between one and two pages in length.\n\nIMPORTANT:  YOU MUST ATTRIBUTE AND DOCUMENT EVERY SOURCE YOU USE IN THE PROPER MLA FORMAT AND INCLUDE A “WORKS CITED” PAGE AT THE END.\n\nDraft (+ 3 extra copies) Due:  SEPTEMBER 28\n\nFinal Draft Due: OCTOBER 5\n\n\nWRITING ASSIGNMENT #2:  Comparing Secondary Sources\n\nCompare, in reference to your primary source text, at least two secondary sources for their reliability and scholarliness, taking into account the sorts of questions listed for your Journal Entry #2.  Which or the sources is superior and why?  Try to determine to what degree your secondary sources might be exemplary the predominant schools of thought of mythological studies and comparative mythology summarized by Birrell (Cf. Birrell 3-4).  NOTE:  Mos","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
