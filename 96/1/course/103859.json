In the course of practicing such skills, we will follow from our reading class and take as our general topic the concept of exploration and discovery, with a special focus on conversation as a free, improvised, exchange of ideas (as opposed to the prepared speeches required for public speaking and dramatic performances).  Our topics will include:  adventure stories from film, legend, fable; non-fiction accounts of archaeological and historical people and events; narratives of our own personal quests and discoveries.","schedule":"Week 1　　9/19　　Intro\nWeek 2　　9/26　　Childhood Hero (“Who I wanted to be”)\nWeek 3　　10/3　　　　part 2\nWeek 4　　10/10　　no class (holiday)\nWeek 5　　10/17　　Interview:  explorers\nWeek 6　　10/24　　Personal object with a history\nWeek 7　　10/31　　　　part 2\nWeek 8　　11/7　　20 questions: invention\nWeek 9　　11/14　　MIDTERM\nWeek 10　　11/21　　group story\nWeek 11　　11/28　　story and picture\nWeek 12　　12/5　　　　part 2\nWeek 13　　12/12　　quotations: explorers and discovers\nWeek 14　　12/19         News report:  “discovery” in the news\nWeek 15　　12/26　　　　part 2\nWeek 16　　1/2　　Film:\nWeek 17　　1/9　　film review\nWeek 18　　1/16　　FINAL EXAM\n","scorePolicy":"Midterm  33.3%\nFinal  33.3%\nParticipation  33.3%\n\nGrading for midterm and final projects on will be based on criteria such as clarity, fluency, originality, and effort.\n","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
