However, some background on signals and systems are strongly recommended. The style of this course is to emphasize the physical meaning of the math equations, instead of deriving them without explanation. A more practical approach is to be used so that students know how to apply the technology of the DPS to real-life problems.","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
