Pearson, 2004.\nCourse Description: 　　This course aims to establish the foundation for English-major students to deliver public speeches in English. Students learn to select topics, collect essential information, analyze the audience, organize materials, improve delivery skills, distinguish different types of speeches, and further to evaluate their own and others’ speeches. Each student is expected to deliver at least 3 individual speeches, and 2-3 debates. Speech topics will be assigned to students. Any modifications of the speech topics will have to be approved by the instructor. All student speech sessions must be videotaped.(*1)\nCourse Requirements: 　　Students’ responsibilities in this class include:\n(1)　　to attend class regularly and to arrive on time: a sign-in sheet to record attendance / a grade reduction of 5% of the semester grade for each class session missed absence\n(2)　　to present materials assigned\n(3)　　to deliver speeches as scheduled:\ni.　　Students are required to present their speeches on the day scheduled;\nii.　　Make-up speech will be allowed only when the failure to perform is due to an officially excused absence at the instructor’s discretion.\niii.　　The ideal time duration for each speech is 4 to 6 minutes. The minimum length of speech time is 3 minutes, and the maximum 6 minutes. Violation of the time limit (less than 3 and more than 6) will create a 10-point deduction. The time length for debates will vary due to the different formats employed.\n(4)　　to submit the speech script and outlining structure (see Appendix 1) to the instructor when presenting the speech. Failure to submit will generate a penalty of 20 points (out of 100) in each speech. Students who fail to comply with the outline format requirements (sampled and specified below)will forfeit the opportunity to deliver the current speech / debate.\n(5)　　to evaluate one’s own speech: speeches will be videotaped and given back to the speakers. Student speakers are required to watch their own videotaped performance, observe their own speeches, and later submit a self-evaluating commentary to the instructor. Facilities and technical support will be provided by the department. A portfolio needs to be established and submitted at the semester end.\n(6)　　to offer constructive opinions and feedbacks of the fellow students as speakers: Students are encouraged to give verbal / oral commentary of the fellow students’ speeches, and with the objectively constructed criticism, the student evaluators will earn 3% grade points to their semester grades.\nGrading Policy: 　　(1) Academic honesty is prioritized in this class. Students should learn that plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students will fail the course without contention once an incident of plagiarism is identified in their submitted writing or presented speech.\n(2) The grading components are as follows:\nComponent　　           Grade Percentage\nAttendance *　　10% (full attendance) (*2)\nIntroductory Speech (impromptu + extemporaneous) 　　10%\nInformative Speech (extemporaneous w/visual aids)　　10%\nPersuasive Speech (extemporaneous)　　10%\nIntroduction to Informative Speech 　　10%\nIntroduction to Persuasive Speech 　　10%\nDebate 1 (Lincoln-Douglas format) 　　15%\nDebate 2 (Parliamentary format) 　　15%\nFinal Debate Match 　　10%\nSpeech Assessment Portfolio (Speech outlines, audios, and notes) 　　Required (*3)\nNotes:\n*1) Student speakers need to videotape their speeches each time and submit the digital recordings at the end of the semester.\n* 2) Students are obligated to attend all class sessions.
