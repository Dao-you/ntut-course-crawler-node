It provides theoretical and experimental insights to examine the phenomenon of language development from multi-disciplinary perspectives. \n\nCourse Objectives:  This course aims to help students \n(1) understand the principles and processes governing L1 &amp; L2 acquisition and learning\n(2) examine how non-native language ability develops\n(3) become familiar with SLA theories to account for many facets of non-native discourse\n","schedule":"Course Requirements:\n(1) All students are required to use a copyrighted textbook. No photocopied edition will be accepted for use in class. It is important for students to be aware that legal action will potentially be sought by the publisher in the case of using an unauthorized duplicated text.  \n(2) Students will form pairs on the first day of class and be responsible for in-class presentations as assigned. \n(3) Each student pair is required to conduct a PPT report on the assigned textbook section (see details). \n(i) Student presentations cover a range of related topics in  Chapter 5, 6, 7, and 9.\n(ii) All PPT presentations need to comply with the format as instructed and modeled by the instructor.\n(iii)Detailed notes of handouts for distribution in class need to incorporate all theories, arguments, discussions and studies reviewed in the textbook. English-Chinese bilingual handouts are preferred. \n(iv) A full-length, revised Chinese translation of the text is due for submission in two weeks after the presentation session. Assignments must be submitted both in electronic and paper forms. \n(4) Each student will be given abundant opportunities to provide his/ her response toward the assigned reading content as the lectures proceed. Students must complete all readings assigned prior to the class session.  \n(5) The instructor will not assign additional readings. However, as SLA is multi-disciplinary in nature, it comprises a broad array of theories and studies. Students who are highly interested in this field are strongly encouraged to consult the professor for further suggested readings.\n(6) Attendance: Students are required to attend the class as scheduled. \ni.Each unexcused absence will result in 10% semester grade deduction. \nii.At the sole discretion of the instructor, some absence penalties may be waived with valid proof and just cause. No Penalty waiver request will only be accepted in two weeks of the date of absence. Students forfeit the right of contention after that. It is important to know that only ONE- time penalty waiver will be granted to any student.  \niii.Lateness to class: Any arrival to class after the instructor finishes the second-round roll call is considered lateness. Two times of lateness will, in effect, incur a grade penalty of 5% semester grade deduction.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nClass Schedule:\n\nWeek 　　Class Task 　　        Lecturer(s)　　\n1_Feb.18　　Orientation + Ch. 1 　　Dr. Yang　　\n2_Feb.25　　Ch. 1 　　                  Dr. Yang　　\n3_Mar.3 　　Ch. 2　　                  Dr. Yang　　\n4_Mar.10　　Ch. 2　　                  Dr. Yang　　\n5_Mar.17　　Ch. 3　　                  Dr. Yang　　\n6_Mar.24　　Ch.3　　                  Dr. Yang　　\n7_Mar.31.　　Ch. 3 +Ch. 4　　         Dr. Yang　　\n8_Apr.7　　Ch. 4 　　                  Dr. Yang　　\n9_Apr.14　　Ch. 4 + Midterm 　　         Dr. Yang　　\n\n10_Apr.21　　Ch. 5 Presentations: pp. 99-124 Dr. Yang + Student Pairs 1-6　　\n11_Apr.28　　Ch. 5 Presentations: pp.99-124  Dr. Yang +Student Pairs 1-6　　\n12_May 5　　Ch. 6 Presentations: pp.127-162 Dr. Yang +Student Pairs 7-14　　\n13_May12　　Ch. 6 Presentations: pp.127-162 Dr. Yang +Student Pairs 7-14　　\n14_May19　　Ch. 6 Presentations: pp.127 -162 + Ch 7.
