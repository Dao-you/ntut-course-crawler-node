We will focus in particular on the relation between writing and argument, looking closely at the structure of introductory paragraphs and thinking about the kinds of questions that are the basis of written arguments.  In the course of practicing such skills, we will take as our general topic the issue of aesthetics (the study of ideas about beauty and about art).   Our topics will include:  favorite artists; ingenious inventions; art and film; storytelling and personal creativity; self-discovery.  \n","schedule":"1　　Intro\n　　What is an Argument?\n\n2　　Review:  chapter 1 readings \nArguments and Problems  (making clear the consequences of a problem)\nonscreen student paragraphs \n　　　　Due:  description of a painting\n\n3　　Problems: Conceptual vs Pragmatic  (Chapter 3)\n　　Discuss student paragraphs\n\n4　　Review chapter 3 part 1 (Tangible and Conceptual Problems) \n+ Discuss part 2 (The Structure of Problems)\n　　Discuss List of Questions (about your painting)\n　　Discuss question form\n　　　　Due:  revision + list of questions\n\n5　　Fairy Tales and Problem Structure\n　　Discuss Students List of Questions\n\n6　　Review:  Fairy Tale Structure\n　　　　Due:  Fairy Tale\n\n7　　no class (holiday) \n\n8　　Style Chapter 1\nGrammar:  sample student sentences\n　　\n\n9　　Style Chapter 2\nGrammar:  sample student sentences\n　　　　Due:  revision of Fairy Tale\n\n10　　Style Chapter 3\n　　　　MIDTERM DUE\n\n11　　Conceptual Problems vs Pragmatic Problems:  student samples in course book\n\n12　　Conceptual problems:  Stable Context\n　　　　　　Due:  revision of midterm\n\n13　　Discuss paragraphs on Museums\n　　　　Due:  Why we hang paintings in a museum\n\n14　　Questions about painting:  developing an intro\n\n15　　Film:  Pygmalion\n　　　　Due:  painting – conceptual intro\n\n16　　Discuss conceptual intro paragraphs\n　　Suggestions for next year (senior projects)\n\n17　　FINAL EXAM due\n","scorePolicy":"Grades:\n　　Writing Assignments / Class work 33.3%\nMidterm project  33.3%\n　　Final project  33.3%\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\n\n","materials":"Books:\n　　Course reader\n","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
