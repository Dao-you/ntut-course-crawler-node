After taking the course, students are expected to be familiar with how to analyze the kinematics, dynamics and control of a robot. Then students will have the basis of how to design a robot for applications.","schedule":"•　　Lec1: Introduction\n•　　Lec2: Coordinate System\n•　　Lec3: Forward Kinematics\n•　　Lec4: Inverse Kinematics\n•　　Lec5: Calibration and Registration\n•　　Lec6: Jacobian\n•　　Lec7: Dynamics\n•　　Lec8: Trajectory Generation\n•　　Lec9: Position Control of Manipulators\n•　　Lec10: Force Control of Manipulators\n•　　Lec11: Visual Servo Kinematics\n","scorePolicy":"Homework : 60%, Midterm exam: 20%, Final Report: 20%","materials":"Textbook: \nIntroduction to robotics: mechanics and control by J.
