This course covers object-oriented modeling for developing software. Materials covered include class models, state models, and interaction models in UML, a reference process model based on Unified process, implementation issues, and software engineering principles. This course is thinking and programming-intensive. Students are required to complete a non-trivial software project in two iterations. Only object-oriented languages such as C++/Java/C# are allowed.\n2. There will be no exams; instead, there are 7 homework assignments and two project reviews. All assignments turned in must be typed (no handwriting will be accepted).\n","scorePolicy":"Homework assignment schedule and grading policy:\nWeek 1　　Homework #1　　Project proposal (due 2/29)　　0%\nWeek 2　　Homework #2　　Iteration 1: Use case (due 3/12)　　10%\nWeek 3　　Homework #3　　Iteration 1: Domain model (due 3/21)　　10%\nWeek 5　　Homework #4　　Iteration 1: Design class diagram (due 4/4)　　10%\nWeek 7,8　　Midterm review　　Project presentation and review; 25 minutes per team.
