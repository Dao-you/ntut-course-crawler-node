To do so, discussions about reading and the composing process that underlie all kinds of writing will be included as the main components in this course. Students are expected to follow this EAP/ESP curriculum designed for this particular group and be able to perform satisfactorily in their academic arena.","schedule":"1 (2/22)　　Introduction of An Experimental Research Report \n      (Text: Writing Up Research: Experimental Research Report \n         Writing for Students of English Chap.1)\n2 (2/29)　　Introduction of Paragraph Writing; Exercise  \n       (Text: Paragraph Development: Chap. 1: The Topic Sentence) \n3 (3/7)  Introduction of Establishing a Context \n      (Text: Writing Up Research: Experimental Research Report \n         Writing for Students of English Chap.2)\n4 (3/14)　　Introduction of Paragraph Writing; Exercise\n      (Text: Paragraph Development: Chap. 2: Supporting Topic \n         Sentence) \n5 (3/21)　　Introduction of Importance of Literature Review (How it \n         relates to present research?)\n      (Text: Writing Up Research: Experimental Research Report \n         Writing for Students of English Chap.3 &amp; 4)\n6 (3/28)　　Introduction of Paragraph Writing; Presentation \n      (Text: Paragraph Development: Chap. 3: Supporting Topic \n         Sentence)\n7 (4/4)　　No Class (Holiday)\n8 (4/11)　　Introduction of Method; Presentation \n      (Text: Writing Up Research: Experimental Research Report \n         Writing for Students of English Chap.5)\n9 (4/18) 　　Introduction of Paragraph Writing; Presentation \n      (Text: Paragraph Development: Chap. 4: Types of Enumeration)\n10 (4/25)　　Introduction of Materials; Presentation \n      (Text: Writing Up Research: Experimental Research Report \n         Writing for Students of English Chap.6)\n11 (5/2)　　Introduction of Paragraph Writing; Presentation \n      (Text: Paragraph Development: Chap. 5: Cause and Effect)\n12 (5/9)　　Introduction of Results; Presentation \n      (Text: Writing Up Research: Experimental Research Report \n         Writing for Students of English Chap.7)\n13 (5/16)　　Introduction of Paragraph Writing; Presentation \n      (Text: Paragraph Development: Chap. 6: Comparison and Contrast)\n14 (5/23)Introduction of Discussion; Presentation \n      (Text: Writing Up Research: Experimental Research Report \n         Writing for Students of English Chap.8)\n15 (5/30)　　Introduction of Paragraph Writing; Presentation \n      (Text: Paragraph Development: Chap. 7: Definition)\n16 (6/6)　　Introduction of Paragraph Writing; Presentation \n      (Text: Paragraph Development: Chap. 8: From Paragraph to \n         Composition)\n17 (6/13)　　Final Exam\n","scorePolicy":"Assignments --------- 30%\nJournal entries------ 25%\nPresentations-------- 30%\nParticipation-------- 15%\n","materials":"(1) Arnaudet, M.
