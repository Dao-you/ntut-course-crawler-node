You may miss up to three sessions without excuse. For each unexcused absence exceeding this limit, 8 points will be subtracted  from your final grade.\nWhen you email me your assignments, please write “advanced writing (number of assignment) (student name)” in the email’s subject heading – e.g., if I were a student in this class and sent the teacher the assignment for May 15th, I’d write: “advanced writing 6 hannes.” Follow the same format in naming the Word document!\n\n","scorePolicy":"　","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
