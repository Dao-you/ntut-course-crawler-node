Project I—Reading the News—emphasizes analysis and argumentation.  After carefully examining two newspaper articles describing the similar event or issue, students will learn to read critically and write their own analysis and viewpoints.  Project II—Critiquing the Arts—involves a writing of analysis on a work of literature or art.  Students will be guided with strategies of critical reading and structures of analysis and formal critique so as to set forth thoughtful responses and formulate a coherent thesis and support it with evidences and arguments.","schedule":"Date　　 Key Topic\n2/20　　 Reading the News—What’s the story (pp. 235-240)\n2/27　　 Reader at Work (pp. 242-3)\n          Writing a News Summary (pp. 250-2)\n3/5　　“The Noose Incident”(pp. 268-271)\n3/12　　“An Appropriate Expression (pp. 271-4)\n3/19　　 Role-playing (274-6)\n3/26　　 Ithacan Inquirer (pp. 276-8)\n4/2　　 Arguing Your Point of View (pp. 278-281)\n4/9　　 Critiquing the Arts--Modes of Argument\n4/16　　 Strategies of Critical Reading\n4/23　　“Hidden Dangers in the Ethnic Revival” \n4/30　　 Analysis and Argument\n5/7　　“A Lack of Religious Values…” \n         “Our Freedom is Threatened…”\n5/14　　Awareness of the Arts\n5/21　　From the Literal to the Suggestive\n5/28　　Literary Significance\n        “The Book of the Grotesque”\n6/4　　The Formal Critique\n6/11　　Reading Poems\n6/18　　Discussion\n","scorePolicy":"1.　　Project I: 20% \n2.　　Project II: 30%\n3.　　Assignments and In-class Practices: 40%\n4.　　Peer-reviewing and Comments: 10%\n","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
