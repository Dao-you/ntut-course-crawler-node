Topics covered include flow in closed conduits and open channels, hydraulic machinery (pumps), and surface water hydrology and statistical methods.  At the successful completion of this course, the student will be able to apply the fundamental principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy to the practical solution of both analysis and design problems in closed and open conduit flows.  The student will also be introduced to hydrology and to methods of quantification of hydrologic uncertainty.\n\nContents:\n1. Introduction\n2. Descriptive and quantitative hydrology\n3.
