We will, in addition, focus on the basic structures of, and purposes for, the paragraph.  The goal of the course is to de-mystify and render transparent what counts as ‘good’, ‘serious’, and ‘beautiful’ English writing.  Thus we will look at the strategic use of basic grammar units—Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, Dependent Clauses, Parallelisms, Sentences Openers and Inversions, Free Modifiers and ‘Branching’, Cohesion, and others—in order to create fluid, concise, and professional English.","schedule":"Texts: Dr. Wall’s Guide to Basic Grammar and Syntax As Style","scorePolicy":"In-class writing exams, Mid-Term, Final","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
