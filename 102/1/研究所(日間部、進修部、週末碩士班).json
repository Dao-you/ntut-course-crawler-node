The cinema has established a tradition of feeding on works of literature as a source of cultural and aesthetic nourishment. But the results for her are \"disastrous to both.\" As she puts it, \"Eye and brain are torn asunder ruthlessly as they try vainly to work in couples.\" Although Woolf might have been over pessimistic about the alliance between works of literature and film adaptations, yet her words ring true at times. In this course, we will explore the limitations and shortcomings as well as the potentialities and strengths of the film adaptations of literary works.

Such a practice aims to help students develop skills in English writing along with those in critical thinking. Topics to be addressed may include the following: \tThe sense-making expressions and structures in English;  \tThe impacts of L1 linguistic/conceptual schemas on the L2 discourse; \tThe lexical/discursive appropriateness in relation to ideological complexes; \tThe conventional and creative discursive patterns and lexical choices in English; \tThe system of values and beliefs that constitutes the English-language communication mode;  \tThe cognitive sophistication and conceptual fluency"},"id":"186962","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"職英文所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=102&sem=1&code=1779","code":"1779"}],"teacher":[{"name":"黃希敏","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=102&sem=1&code=10970","code":"10970"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":["A","B","C"],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"共同301_1","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=102&sem=1&code=117","code":"117"}],"people":"13","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=5415104","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=186962&code=10970"]},{"code":"5415103","name":{"zh":"社會語言學應用研究","en":"Applied Research of Sociolinguistics"},"description":{"zh":"本課程廣泛介紹社會語言學的各個次領域，目的在引導學生瞭解此領域早期的基礎研究與現代的關注議題。學生可藉此認識英語在社會上的運用以及各種社會變因對於語言運作的影響。修完本課程後，學生有能力辨認現代英語的不同語體、解釋語言使用所牽涉到的社會因素、運用社會語言學中適切的研究方法完成語言研究，並能將社會語言學的概念應用到語言教學。","en":"This course provides a comprehensive overview of sociolinguistic subcategories with the goal of introducing students to both early foundational work and current issues in this field.

Teaching outlines of the course can be divided into the followings:Introduction to fuel cell system, Efficiency and open voltage, Operational fuel cell voltages, Proton exchange membrane fuel cell, Phosphoric acid fuel cell, Alkaline fuel cell, Direct methanol fuel cell, Solid oxide fuel cell, Fueling fuel cell, Delivering fuel cell power, Analysis of fuel cell system."},"id":"187152","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"職能源所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=102&sem=1&code=1775","code":"1775"}],"teacher":[{"name":"顏維謀","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=102&sem=1&code=11677","code":"11677"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":["A","B","C"],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教402(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=102&sem=1&code=52","code":"52"}],"people":"13","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=4505515","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=187152&code=11677"]},{"code":"4107002","name":{"zh":"專題討論","en":"Engineering Seminar"},"description":{"zh":"專題報告專題演講 研究小組討論","en":"Case Study.Seminar.Group meeting."},"id":"187170","stage":"1","credit":"1.0","hours":"2","courseType":"▲","class":[{"name":"電通所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=102&sem=1&code=1737","code":"1737"}],"teacher":[{"name":"孫卓勳","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=102&sem=1&code=10618","code":"10618"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["8","9"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教406(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=102&sem=1&code=54","code":"54"}],"people":"26","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"博士班","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=4107002","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=187170&code=10618"]},{"code":"4125033","name":{"zh":"語音訊號處理","en":"Speech Signal Processing"},"description":{"zh":"本課程將探討語音訊號的相關的各種基礎知識與處理技術，包括語音辨認，語音合成與口語對話系統等，並將檢視數個具目前最先進技術的系統，使學生能建立語音信號處理技術之基本知識及能力。課程內容包括：*語音的產生，語音訊號聲學特性與語音知覺的原理*語音分析*語音辨識*語音合成*口語對話系統*目前最先進技術系統*相關進階議題","en":"In this course, we will introduce fundamental speech signal processing techniques, including speech recognition, speech synthesis and spoken dialogue system and examine some state-of-the-art systems.Content:*Overview of Speech Processing Techniques*Speech Production, Acoustic Phonetics and Psychoacoustic Phenomena*Speech Analysis*Speech Recognition*Speech Synthesis*Spoken Dialog System*State-of-the-Art Systems*Selected Advanced Topics"},"id":"187171","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電通所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=102&sem=1&code=1737","code":"1737"}],"teacher":[{"name":"廖元甫","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=102&sem=1&code=11056","code":"11056"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":["6","7","8"],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"光華館404","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=102&sem=1&code=510","code":"510"}],"people":"14","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=4125033","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=187171&code=11056"]},{"code":"4145023","name":{"zh":"半導體製造技術","en":"Semiconductor Fabrication Technologies"},"description":{"zh":"1.MOS元件工作模式及MOSFET原理 2.微小MOSFET的額外考慮 3.矽晶圓的生長 4.擴 散 5.離子植入 6.氧化處理 7.CVD技術 8.微影術 9.蒸鍍與濺鍍 10.光罩製作 11.CMOS IC製程","en":"1.
