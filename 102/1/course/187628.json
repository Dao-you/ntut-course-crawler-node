The course deals with the types of experiments that are frequently conducted in industrial settings. The goal is for you to learn how to plan, design, and conduct experiments efficiently and effectively, and learn how to analyze the resulting data to obtain objective conclusions. Both design and analysis issues are discussed. \n\n本課程為本研究所第一門教授設計實驗並分析後續實驗數據的課程，其目的在於教授學生如何有效地、有效率地規劃、設計、並執行實驗。","schedule":"1.　　Fundamentals of engineering statistics &amp; principles of experimentation\n2.　　Simple comparative experiments; one-way ANOVA &amp; CRD (completely randomized design)\n3.　　RCBD (randomized complete block design) &amp; Latin square designs\n4.　　Factorial design &amp; 2k factorial design\n5.　　Blocking &amp; confounding in 2k factorial design\n6.　　2-level fractional factorial design &amp; its resolution; 3-level (fractional) factorial designs\n7.　　Fitting regression model: Estimation, Diagnostics and Prediction\n8.　　Response surface methodology &amp; process optimization (including EVOP &amp; Simplex EVOP)\n9.　　Random effects model\n10.　　Nested &amp; split-plot designs\n11.　　Box-Cox transformation &amp; GLM\n12.　　Unbalanced design (missing data) &amp; covariance analysis of factorial design \n13.　　Computer-generated (optimal) design theory\n14.　　New materials from the recent literature (JQT, Technometrics, among others)\nTopics 12-14 are restricted by time available.\n\nDOE-RELATED JOURNALS FOR PAPER READING ASSIGNMENT\n\n1.　　Journal of Quality Technology\n2.　　Technometrics\n3.　　Quality Engineering\n4.　　The American Statistician\n5.　　Communications in Statistics: Simulation and Computation\n6.　　Communications in Statistics: Theory and Methods\n7.　　Applied Statistics (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, series C)\n8.　　Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, series B\n9.　　Biometrika\n10.　　Journal of the American Statistical Association\n11.　　Biometrics\n12.　　The Annals of Statistics\n13.　　Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics\n14.　　Canadian Journal of Statistics\n15.　　Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference\n16.　　Quality and Reliability Engineering International\n17.　　Statistica Sinica\n18.　　Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation\n19.　　Metrika\n20.　　Probability &amp; Statistics Letters\n21.　　Journal of Probability &amp; Statistical Science\n22.　　Journal of Applied Statistics\n\nPrerequisite concepts\n\n• Random variables (definition, Functions of random variables, Expectation and Variance operators)\n• Random sampling\n• Properties of point estimators (bias, variance, mean square error)\n• Maximum likelihood estimation\n• Sampling distributions (distributions that originate from sampling):\n– Normal\n– Student’s t\n– Chi-square\n– F\n(definitions of each of the above, relations between them).\n• Use of sampling distributions to build confidence interval estimators and test hypotheses for\nmeans and variances of normal populations and differences between means and variances from two different populations.\n• Central limit theorem","scorePolicy":"Assignment 20%, 3 examinations 60%, and Term Project 20%","materials":"Montgomery, D.
