In keeping with its status as a foundation course, this course assumes no prior formal knowledge of marketing.  Because you are all consumers, however, you have a great deal of informal knowledge of marketing as a result of being on the receiving end of marketing actions.  We will try to draw on this informal knowledge as much as possible.","schedule":"Week 1: Course Overview\nWeek 2: What is Marketing\nWeek 3: Develop Marketing Strategy and Plan\nWeek 4: Market Segmentation #1\nWeek 5: Market Segmentation #2\nWeek 6: Market Segmentation #3\nWeek 7: Data-driven marketing decision #1\nWeek 8: Data-driven marketing decision #2\nWeek 9: Exam 1\nWeek 10: Customer choices and decision-making process\nWeek 11: Business market and organization buying process\n               Customer relationship management and customer lifetime value\nWeek 12: Case 1 presentation\nWeek 13: Pricing and marketing mathematics \nWeek 14: Brand, Product management and new product development \nWeek 15: Channel management \nWeek 16: Promotion and marketing communication \nWeek 17: Case 2 presentation\nWeek 18: Exam 2","scorePolicy":"20% Case Analysis 1\n20% Case Analysis 2\n25% Exam 1\n25% Exam 2\n5%  Class Participation\n5%  Intellectual Contribution in Case Analysis","materials":"Text: Kolter, Keller, Ang, Leong, and Tan.
