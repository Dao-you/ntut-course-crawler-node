More and more, as consumers, we can share our experiences. For a company, great experiences can be a competitive advantage. They can keep your customers loyal and turn them into your biggest cheerleaders. On the flip side, terrible experiences can stop you in your tracks very quickly. No one wants to be that company being talked about for all the wrong reasons. Building great user experiences requires listening and empathy. In this course you’ll learn the tools and techniques to make your design/products delightful for users.\nThis course is an introduction to User Experience with a focus on Space, Product, and Interaction Design. Students create a complete UX brief, from ideation to annotated wireframes that could be handed off to a developer to be built. They will also learn to conduct the research necessary and create all the supporting documentation required to defend their design decisions. There is a large focus on how to dissect and analyze common design patterns.\nThis class is an interdisciplinary integration course. The majority of students are design college students looking to transition their skills into digital, or product managers looking to improve their design skills. Other students often include engineers who want to learn how to make their design/products more usable and entrepreneurs looking to build out the user experience for their idea.","schedule":"Unit 1: Principles and Process\nIntroduction to UX\n��　　Describe the field of UX and how it relates to other disciplines\n��　　Outline the stages in the UX process\n��　　Identify the structure and purpose of various design deliverables\nUser Research and Personas\n��　　Write a questionnaire\n��　　Interview users in context\n��　　Identify User Centered Design techniques\n��　　Create effective personas to define the users one is trying to reach\nUX Analysis\n��　　Ask questions that discover key business needs\n��　　Describe the benefits to an MVP approach\n��　　Given a goal, identify the tasks for a user to complete that goal and draw the user flow\n��　　Given a problem and a determined feature set, use a competitive audit to determine if there are different ways to implement the feature\n��　　Prioritize features based on essentialness and level of effort\nUnit 2: UX Toolkit and Measurement\nCreating Wireframes and Prototypes\n��　　Identify and describe tools for wireframing, prototyping, advanced drawing, and creating clickable drawings\n��　　Create wireframes, clickable drawings, and prototypes\nUsability Principles and Testing\n��　　Evaluate user experience of given websites and products, using Jakob Nielsen's 5 Principles of Usability\n��　　Define each type of usability test and determine when to use each\n��　　Run a usability test using best practices\nUser Experience Measurement\n��　　Measuring user experience by participant observation\n��　　Eye tracking basic, applications and implementation on user experience analysis\n��　　Using Electroencephalography (EEG) in a usability test of a survey\n��　　Scientific data analysis and big data analysis\nUnit 3: Practices for Design Patterns\nInteraction Design in Space\nProduct Service System User Experience Survey\nService Design of Interactive Media Design\nSocial Experiences Design and Evaluation","scorePolicy":"Participation 　　20%\nProject I  　　10%\nProject II  　　10%\nMidTerm Project  　　20%\nTerm Project and Paper  　　40%","materials":"1.　　Research Based Web Design &amp; Usability Guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Available as free PDF from http://usability.gov/guidelines/guidelines_book.pdf\n2.　　Moggridge, B, Designing interactions, MIT press, (2007).
