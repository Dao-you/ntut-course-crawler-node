The purpose of this course is to learn the concepts and physical principles of water flow as well as the techniques that can be used to solve hydrologic problems. Thus, one of the goals of this course is to give you a balanced view of hydrology - one that includes a description of the physical processes plus a coherent presentation of the theories and techniques that are used in practice.","schedule":"1.　　Hydrological cycle.\n2-4.　　Frequency analysis.\n5-6.　　Precipitation.\n7-8.　　Losses from precipitation.\n10-12.　　Hydrograph.\n13-14.　　Flood routing.\n15.　　Hydrological measurement.\n16-17.　　Groundwater.\n16-17.　　Groundwater.","scorePolicy":"Workload: Midterm and final exam(s), tests, and homework.  Homework assignments will be handed out in class after pertinent subject matter is covered in the lecture and graded regularly.  Students will have one week to submit the homework assignment. Timely submission of homework is essential.  NO LATE HOMEWORK WILL BE ACCEPTED.\nGrade: 25% tests, 25% midterm exam, 30% final exam, 10% Homework, 10% class participation.","materials":"Patra, K.C. 2012.
