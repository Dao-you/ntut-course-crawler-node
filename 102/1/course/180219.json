We will also attempt to discern what relationship there might be between such literatures and  various musics of the world, particularly rural American blues, ancient Celtic ballads, reggae, and jazz.  Anticipated films include:  Percy Henzell’s The Harder They Come, Marcel Camus’ Black Orpheus and The Cry of Jazz which features early performances by the Sun Ra Archestra.  Through exposure to poetry, art, song, film, history, mythology, literary theory and consciousness studies, students will be able to acquire a more sophisticated, nuanced view of culture in its aesthetic expression, and a greater appreciation for the manner in which art and culture continually shape and reshape one another.\n\nSTUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n1)  Journals.  Students must keep a journal on an ongoing basis containing responses to the works they are examining and share these writings with the rest of the class.  To receive full credit, you must bring your journal entry to class and read it aloud on the day that it is due.  I will not accept late or e-mailed journal entries or writing assignments.\n\n2) Presentations.  Students will give an oral presentation in concert with two or three classmates.  Preparation of these presentations will lead to development and refinement of your understanding of literature, and will provide a meaningful context for discussion in the class.\n\n3)  Attendance.  Frequent attendance is mandatory.  After your first two absences, each subsequent unexcused absence will cause your final grade to be reduced by one grade point.  If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out the substance of class discussions and to make up homework.  \n\n4)  Anyone caught plagiarizing will receive a failing grade in the course.  All outside sources that you use in the production of your papers must be properly attributed using the MLA format.\n\n\nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n\nSeptember 15　　INTRODUCTION:  Oral versus written forms of cultural expression \n\nSeptember 22　　Hoodoo, Voodoo and the Blues:  Robert Johnson and Lucille Bogan\n\nOctober 29　　Zora Neale Hurston’s Folk Tales and Uncle Remus\n\nOctober 6　　Caribbean Culture:  Kamau Brathwaite\n\nOctober 13　　Rastafarianism and Reggae\n\nOctober 20　　Indigenous Cultures:  Native American and Mexican \n\nOctober 27　　 Indigenous Cultures:  Hawaii, Taiwan\n\nNovember 3　　African Culture and Ifa Divionation\n\nNovember 10　　Contemporary Anglo-Nigerian Literature:  Obotunde Ijimere.\n\nNovember 17　　MIDTERM EXAM  \n\nNovember 24　　Celtic Mythology I\n\nDecember 1　　Celtic Mythology II\n\nDecember 8　　Irish Literature I\n\nDecember 15　　Irish Literature II\n\nDecember 29　　GROUP PRESENTATIONS\n\nJanuary 5　　GROUP PRESENTATION\n\nJanuary 12　　FINAL PAPER DUE (No e-mails, please.)\n\n\n*Presentation proposal (which should be completed for both presentation A and presentation B) may be in rough or outline form, but should contain the main points that you will be covering in your presentation.
