However, the listening, note-taking, and discussion tasks help students develop the skills they need for study in any academic discipline.  Students are also given opportunities to practice giving individual/paired and group presentations over textbook content and researched information.  Listening activities will center on the listening of academic lectures and less formal interviews.  Dialogue journals will be used as the method of providing students with the opportunity to improve English writing.  \n\nCourse Objectives:  By the end of the course students will have:\n‧　　Shown knowledge of how to take notes on academic lectures to answer questions.  \n‧　　Shown written English improvement.\n‧　　Successfully given an individual/paired short presentation.\n‧　　Successfully done research and given short group presentations.\n‧　　Shown the ability to participate in class discussions.\n\nInstructional Activities:  This course is first and foremost a discussion course.  Students must actively participate in class through discussion with the teacher and classmates.  Students will follow their textbook as it guides them in the discussion of American history and culture.  When expected, students are expected to present their ideas during presentations.  Dialogue journals will be used to allow students the opportunity to critically discuss what has been discussed during class.  \n\nDialogue journals are written conversations between student and teacher.  Topics will be selected by both the student and by the teacher.  Students will write an entry and the teacher responds.  The student then reads what the teacher has written and responds.  The student determines how long or short the entry will be.  This will decide how long or short the reply from the teacher will be.  This journal will provide a student with the opportunity to practice writing at one’s own level, receive individualized attention and regular positive feedback, write and read for authentic purpose –to communicate (fluency) but have the teacher model correct usage (accuracy), have the opportunity for reflection and personal response, and have a record of written language development.  This type of writing also allows the teacher to become more acquainted with individual students, provide individualized instruction, and receive frequent assessment of student progress.  There will be time set aside at the beginning of each class for dialogue journal writing time.  Students should retrieve their journals from the tea","schedule":"Weekly Schedule:\nWeek　　Date　　Class Work　　Homework\nWeek 1　　9/12　　課程大綱簡介\n詞彙能力測驗　　買課本—XXXX p. xxiii; Review the map on page xxv\nWeek 2　　9/19　　老師生日－停課一次 (也是中秋節－hahaha)　　\nWeek 3　　9/26　　Chapter 1: The Foundations of Government　　\nWeek 4　　10/3　　Chapter 1: The Foundations of Government　　\nWeek 5　　10/10　　國慶日－臺灣No. 1－停課一次　　\nWeek 6　　10/17　　Chapter 2: Constitutional Issues Today　　\nWeek 7　　10/24　　Chapter 2: Constitutional Issues Today　　\nWeek 8　　10/31　　Chapter 3: The Origins of Diversity　　準備期中考\nWeek 9　　11/7　　期中考　　\nWeek 10　　11/14　　Chapter 3: The Origins of Diversity　　Prepare Group Presentations (#1)\nWeek 11　　11/21　　Group Presentations　　\nWeek 12　　11/28　　Chapter 4: Diversity in Today’s United States　　\nWeek 13　　12/5　　Chapter 4: Diversity in Today’s United States　　Prepare Individual/Paired Presentations\nWeek 14　　12/12　　Individual/Paired Presentations　　\nWeek 15　　12/19　　Chapter 5: The Struggle Begins　　\nWeek 16　　12/26　　Chapter 5: The Struggle Begins　　Prepare Group Presentations (#2)\nWeek 17　　1/2　　Group Presentations　　準備期末考\nWeek 18　　1/9　　期末考","scorePolicy":"Grading Procedures:  Course grades will be calculated in the following manner:\n\n期中考 (Chapters 1-2)　　　　　　　　　　　　20%.\n　　期末考 (Chapters 3-5)　　　　　　　　　　　　30%\n　　出席率　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　10%\n　　Two Group Presentations　　　　　　　　　　　　10%\n　　Individual (or Paired) Presentation　　　　　　　　　　10%\n　　Dialogue Journals　　　　　　　　　　　　　　20%\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Total:　　100 pts.\n\nA　　90-100\nB　　80-89\nC　　70-79\nD　　60-69\nF　　59 &amp; BELOW","materials":"上課規則:\n1.　　老師授課時，請同學保持安靜，不要與同學交頭接耳。\n2.　　上課中請勿製造噪音(例如隨意講話，大聲整理東西，摔門，等等) 。\n3.　　上課時不可以吃東西（兩堂課中間休息時可以）。飲料沒問題。\n4.　　不來上課的同學注意喔！要補考（小；期中；期末）的學生必須出示醫生開立之證明或訃聞才可以補考。","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
