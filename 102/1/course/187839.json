Core concepts will be presented by both students and course instructor via lecture presentations, discussions and with real time experiments. The curriculum will be wide in scope incorporating aspects of trouble shooting, experimental result discussion, chemical measurements, modern analytical instrumentation, and determination of chemical structure via analytical techniques. Special emphasis will be put on the appropriate preparation, and meaningful presentation, of scientific results. The student is expected to dedicate significant effort both in and out of lectures to be successful.","schedule":"Raman spectroscopy - Raman scattering - stoke's and anti stokes lines - instrumentation - differences between IR and Raman spectroscopy - mutual exclusion principle - applications - structural diagnosis.\n\nUV- Visible spectroscopy - Absorbtion laws - calculations involving Beer - lambert's law - instrumentation - spectrophotometer - block diagrams with description of components - theory - factors governing absorbtion maximum and intensity\n\nInfrared spectroscopy - principle - types of stretching and bending vibrations - vibrational frequencies - instrumentation - block diagram - source - detector and recorders \n\nChromatography techniques -Principles adsorption, thin layer, partition and paper. chromatography column chromatography - and applications.
