We will examine mythic texts from the most ancient times--the Descent of Inanna, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Popul Vuh--alongside more modern works--the poems of Saint John of the Cross, the Great Vision of Black Elk, Beelzebub`s Tales to his Grandson--through an anthropological lens provided in part by theorists Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, Victor Turner and Jean Gebser.  We will trace back to their roots both poetry and its close relation divination, and show how the artistic impulse in humanity, though varying much according to history, culture and environment, still has echoes in the music, poetry and novels of modern times—just witness the great blues tradition; contemporary poetry by Nathanial Mackey, Nathaniel Braithwaite and Cecilia Vicuna; and fiction by Jack London, Isabelle Allende and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  Coursework includes the keeping and sharing, regularly, of a journal, multiple in-class presentations and the composition of two essays.\n\n\nSTUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n1)  Journals.  Students must keep a journal on an ongoing basis containing responses to the works they are examining and share these writings with the rest of the class.  To receive full credit, you must bring your journal entry to class and read it aloud on the day that it is due.  I will not accept late or e-mailed journal entries or writing assignments.\n\n2) Presentations.  Students will give an oral presentation in concert with two or three classmates.  Preparation of these presentations will lead to development and refinement of your understanding of literature, and will provide a meaningful context for discussion in the class.\n\n3)  Attendance.  Frequent attendance is mandatory.  After your first two absences, each subsequent unexcused absence will cause your final grade to be reduced by one grade point.  If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out the substance of class discussions and to make up homework.  \n\n4)  Anyone caught plagiarizing will receive a failing grade in the course.  All outside sources that you use in the production of your papers must be properly attributed using the MLA format.\n\nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n\nPart One:  Ancient Sources\n\nSeptember 15　　INTRODUCTION:  Creating ritual manifold.
