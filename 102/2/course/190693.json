The fundamental theoretical and empirical equations that are developed in soil mechanics can be properly used in practice if, and only if, the physical parameters used in those equations are properly evaluated in the laboratory. So, learning to perform laboratory tests of soils plays an important role in the geotechnical engineering profession.","schedule":"1.  Introduction of Soil Lab Testing\n2.
