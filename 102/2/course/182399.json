Both have a maximum time limit of three minutes.  Anyone speaking for less than two minutes or more than three minutes will be penalized.  Signals will be given to keep you informed as to the time.\n\n2)  Attendance.  Frequent attendance is mandatory.  After your first two absences, each subsequent unexcused absence will cause your final grade to be reduced by five grade points.  If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out the substance of class discussions and to make up homework.  \n\n5)  Anyone caught plagiarizing will receive a failing grade in the course.  All outside sources that you use in the production of your oral auditions must be acknowledged within the body of your talk.","schedule":"Week One:  Textbook reading + group A\nWeek Two:  Textbook reading + group B\nWeek Three:  Textbook reading + group A\nWeek Four:  Classes Cancelled\nWeek Five:  Textbook reading + group B \nWeek Six:  Monday meet as a group + Tuesday study for midterm\nWeek Seven (April 1):  MIDTERM\nWeek Eight:  Group A + textbook reading + oral auditions I (impromptu)\nWeek Nine:  Group B + textbook reading + oral auditions I  (impromptu)\nWeek Ten:  Group A + textbook reading + oral auditions I  (impromptu)\nWeek Eleven:  Group B + textbook reading + oral auditions I  (impromptu)\nWeek Twelve:  Group A + textbook reading + oral auditions I  (impromptu)\nWeek Thirteen:  Group B + textbook reading + oral auditions I  (impromptu)\nWeek Fourteen:  Oral auditions II  (prepared)\nWeek Fifteen:  Oral auditions II  (prepared)\nWeek Sixteen:  Oral auditions II  (prepared)\nWeek Seventeen:  STUDY FOR MIDTERM\nWeek Eighteen (June 17):  MIDTERM","scorePolicy":"50%　　Coursework (Homework, participation +extra credit for English Corner, TED, etc.)\n20%　　Oral Auditions (Max. 3 minute impromptu + prepared talks on subjects related to class readings)\n15%　　Midterm\n15% 　　Final","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
