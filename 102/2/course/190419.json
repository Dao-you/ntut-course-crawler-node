The course examines the basic scientific principles underlying these phenomena and introduces students to a range of technologies and analysis techniques for designing comfortable indoor environments. Students will be challenged to apply these techniques and explore the role light, energy and sound can play in shaping architecture.","schedule":"Week 01: Course Introduction\nWeek 02: Measuring Climate\nWeek 03: Solar Radiation\nWeek 04: Heat Storage and Thermal Mass\nWeek 05: Infiltration and Internal Gains\nWeek 06: Load Calculations\nWeek 07: Building Optimization Simulation I\nWeek 08: Daylight\nWeek 09: Electric Lighting\nWeek 10: Daylight Simulation\nWeek 11: Solar Hot Water\nWeek 12: Climate Analysis\nWeek 13: Natural Ventilation\nWeek 14: Building Optimization Simulation II\nWeek 15: HVAC\nWeek 16: Room Acoustics &amp; Sound Attenuation \nWeek 17: Life Cycle Assessments\nWeek 18: Semester Project Presentation","scorePolicy":"50% - Assigned Readings/Assignments\n30% - Class Presentations and Reports\n20% - Semester Project","materials":"1.
