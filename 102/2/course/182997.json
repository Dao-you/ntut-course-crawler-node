Britain, and France) imagines the East (Persia, China, India, Vietnam, Japan) or, to put it differently, the way in which the West represents the East to itself, and thus the course is as much a course in cultural miscommunication as it is in cultural communication.  The course will be a study in reality, illusion, fantasy, stereotype, desire, deconstruction, globalism, and ideology, among other topics.","schedule":"Introduction\n \n300 [2007]\nLecture on 300: Ideology\n \nBlack Narcissus [1947]\nLecture on Black Narcissus: Desire\n \nKeys to the Kingdom [1944]\nLecture on Keys to the Kingdom: Stereotype, cliche\n \nMID-TERM 40%\n \nM Butterfly [1993]\nLecture on M Butterfly: Deconstruction\n \nMemoirs of a Geisha [2005]\nLecture on Memoirs of a Geisha: “Woman does not exist”\n \nL’Amant [The Lover] [1992]\nLecture on L’Amant: Cross Cultural Love and Destruction\n \nThe Fly [1986]\nLecture on The Fly: Globalism\n \nReview\n \nWk 18: FINAL EXAM 60%","scorePolicy":"Text: Photocopy lectures.\nEvaluation: Mid-Term Exam 40 %.
