L. Schodek, P. Ferreira and M. F. Ashby, “Nanomaterials, Nanotechnologies and Design: An Introduction for Engineers and Architects” Butterworth-Heinemann (June 11, 2009)\nCourse Objectives:　　\nA. Provide a brief review of material history\nB. Provide a brief review of nanotechnology\nC. Learn to understand the properties of nanomaterials\nD. Learn to understand the chemistry of nanomaterials","schedule":"Course Outline:\n1.　　Nanomaterials and Nanotechnologies\n2.　　An Evolutionary Perspective\n3.　　The Design Context\n4.　　Material Classes, Structure, and Properties\n5.　　Material Property Charty and Their Uses\n6.　　Nanomaterials: Class and Fundamentals\n7.　　Nanomaterials: Properties\n8.　　Nanomaterials: Synthesis and Characterization\n9.　　Design Environments and Systems\n10.　　Nanomaterial Product Forms and Functions\n11.　　Nanomaterial and Nanotechnologies in Health and Environment\n12.　　The Broader Context","scorePolicy":"Grades: \nGrades will be determined from a composite score of all graded materials, consisting of: two midterm exams, homework problems, and the comprehensive final exam. Weights used to determine the final score will be:\n1. Homework problems, 15%\n2. In-Class Activities, Quizzes 10%\n3. Two exams, 60% (midterm 30%, final 30%)\n4. Final Project, 15%\nHomework Rules:　　　　\n1.　　Homework problems are due at the beginning of class.\n2.　　Please work the homework early to avoid lateness due to computer crashes.\n3.　　Answer keys will be posted on http://elearning.ntut.edu.tw \n4.　　You may discuss with others how to begin working problems, but you must work the problem entirely yourself to hand in for credit. You may not share computer files for homework problems until the case study.\n5.　　Anyone who share computer files or copy homework from classmates will subject to a 50% off his/her homework credit.\nExams:\nAll exams will be held in our normal classroom.\nFinal Exam:\nAll students must take the final exam to pass the course. Finals will not be given at any other time. There will not be a makeup exam.","materials":"References:\n1.　　L. E.
