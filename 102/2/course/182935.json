[{"name":"柯萊恩","email":"kcline@ntut.edu.tw","latestUpdate":"2014-02-17 10:36:32","objective":"In this course we will examine modern literary works from its first intimations in the 19th century to its more overt inception within the 20th—and moving into the 21st.  After a consideration of the meaning of \"modernity\" from an a-historical framework, we will look at key Modernist and Post-Modern poetry, short fiction and film.  In the period between WWI and WWII, international artistic movements such as the Futurists, Dadaists and Surrealists, as well as American writers Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and film makers such as Buster Keaton helped to define a new Modernist impulse in the West; after WWII, post-modern writers such as the poets of the Beat and New York School movements,  fiction writers Thomas Disch and Philip K. Dick and dramatists such as Samuel Beckett took up where the Modernists had left off, but were faced with still more complex aesthetic, political and spiritual challenges.\n\nSTUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n1)  Journals.  Students must keep a journal containing responses to the works we are examining and share these writings with the class on a regular basis. Generally speaking, each Journal Entry will correspond with the works we are studying.  I will be suggesting one or more ideas ideas to explore in your entries during a portion of the course lecture briefly introducing each weeks upcoming reading assignment. I will collect journals during the semester to check on your progress.  \n\n2) Performance.  Students will give a (quite short) dramatic performance in concert with two or three classmates.  Full participation in all aspects of this performance—from the selection of a short play, to its rehearsal and preparation, to its performance is MANDATORY.).\n\n3)  Attendance.  Frequent attendance is mandatory.  After your first two absences, each subsequent unexcused absence will cause your final grade to be reduced by five points.  If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out the substance of class discussions and to make up homework.  Since I generally take roll in the first five minutes of class, if you come in late you may be marked absent.  It is your responsibility to let me know if you've been tardy after class ON THE DAY THAT YOU ARE LATE.  Three tardies = one absence.\n\n4)  Anyone caught plagiarizing will receive a failing grade in the course.","schedule":"All assignments journal entries and reading tasks are due next class session unless otherwise indicated.  \n\nFebruary 18　　Introduction: Intimations of Modernity  ASSIGNMENT:READ Poe “the Imp of the Perverse and WRITE Journal Entry #1\n\nFebruary 25　　What is Modern?
