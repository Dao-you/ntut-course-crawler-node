However, the listening, note-taking, reading, writing, and discussion tasks help students develop the skills they need for study in any academic discipline. Dialogue journals will be used as the method of providing students with the opportunity to improve English writing.  Both intensive and extensive reading will be practiced inside and outside of class.  \n\nCourse Objectives:  By the end of the course students will have shown:\n‧　　knowledge of how to take notes on academic lectures to answer questions.  \n‧　　the ability to participate in class discussions.\n‧　　knowledge of how to appropriately apply vocabulary, reading, and writing skills. \n‧　　ability to read intensively and extensively to acquire content knowledge.  \n\nInstructional Activities:  This course is first and foremost a reading course.  Students will follow their textbook as it guides them in the acquisition of American history and culture as course content.  Dialogue journals will be used to allow students the opportunity to critique what has been discussed during class.  Students will practice a number of note-taking and reading comprehension tasks inside of class. One intensive reading assignment will be completed in class that will require students to read a lengthy piece of writing without the aid of a dictionary in a short period of time.  Students are encouraged to preview all the material before class in order to not fall behind.  \n\nDialogue journals are written conversations between student and teacher.  Topics will be selected by both the student and by the teacher.  Students will write an entry and the teacher responds.  The student then reads what the teacher has written and responds.  The student determines how long or short the entry will be.  This will decide how long or short the reply from the teacher will be.  This journal will provide a student with the opportunity to practice writing at one’s own level, receive individualized attention and regular positive feedback, write and read for authentic purpose –to communicate (fluency) but have the teacher model correct usage (accuracy), have the opportunity for reflection and personal response, and have a record of written language development.  This type of writing also allows the teacher to become more acquainted with individual students, provide individualized instruction, and receive frequent assessment of student progress.  There will be time set aside at the beginning of each class for dialogue journal writing tim","schedule":"Weekly Schedule:\nWeek　　Date　　Class Work　　Homework\nWeek 1　　2/20　　課程大綱簡介\nDialogue Journal Writing #1 (Written Prompt)　　\nWeek 2　　2/27　　Reading – Chapter 6 pp. 119- 140\nDialogue Journal Writing #2 (Written Prompt) – p. 139-140　　\nWeek 3　　3/6　　Reading – Chapter 7 pp. 141-163\nDialogue Journal Writing #3 (Written Prompt) – p. 164-165　　\nWeek 4　　3/13　　Reading – Chapter 8 pp. 166-184\nDialogue Journal Writing #4 (Written Prompt) – p. 185-186　　\nWeek 5　　3/20　　Reading – Chapter 9 pp. 187-208\nDialogue Journal Writing #5 (Written Prompt) – p. 209-210　　\nWeek 6　　3/27　　Reading – Chapter 10 pp. 211-231 \nDialogue Journal Writing #6 (Written Prompt) – p. 232-233　　\nWeek 7　　4/3　　Holiday Compensation for Sports Day　　\nWeek 8　　4/10　　Dialogue Journal Writing #7 (Video Prompt) \nListening Chapter 6 p. 81-96　　準備期中考\nWeek 9　　4/17　　Reading/Writing期中考　　\nWeek 10　　4/24　　Dialogue Journal Writing #8 (Video Prompt)\nListening Chapter 6 p. 81-96　　\nWeek 11　　5/1　　Intensive Reading Activity　　\nWeek 12　　5/8　　Intensive Reading Activity　　\nWeek 13　　5/15　　Intensive Reading Activity　　\nWeek 14　　5/22　　Listening Chapter 7 p. 97-111　　\nWeek 15　　5/29　　Listening Chapter 8 p. 112-128　　\nWeek 16　　6/5　　Listening Chapter 9 p. 129-143　　\nWeek 17　　6/12　　Listening Chapter 10 p. 144-159　　準備期末考\nWeek 18　　6/19　　Listening/Note Taking期末考","scorePolicy":"Grading Procedures:  Course grades will be calculated in the following manner:\n\nReading/Writing期中考 (Chapters 6-10)　　　　　　　　35%.\n　　Listening/Note Taking期末考 (Chapters 6-10)　　　　　　35%\n　　出席率　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　10%\n　　Intensive Reading Activity　　　　　　　　　　　　10%\n　　Dialogue Journals (x8)　　　　　　　　　　　　10%\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Total:　　100 pts.\n\nA　　90-100\nB　　80-89\nC　　70-79\nD　　60-69\nF　　59 &amp; BELOW","materials":"Text and References:　　\nSanabria, K. &amp; Sanabria, C.
