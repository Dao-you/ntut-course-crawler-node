Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. As people often observe, Shakespeare may trigger our imagination with his language and promote effective communication in every aspect of our life, including that of our careers.

These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.
