Hybrid cars can achieve the objective of environmental protection and energy saving, but they are still expensive compared to conventional vehicles. Hydraulic hybrid vehicles use engines and hydraulic motor/pump as alternate power source. The energy storage elements are high pressure hydraulic/pneumatic accumulators thanks.  With the aid of hydraulic motor/pump and high pressure hydraulic/pneumatic accumulators’ thanks, the brake-generated power recovery is achieved and reused in turn for acceleration.
