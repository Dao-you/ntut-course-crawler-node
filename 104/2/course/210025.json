Students will learn how to plan, design, plot diagrams before diving into time-consuming programming of their programs or information system. It also introduces how to co-program in a team and how to lead a team of programmers by programming plans, designs, and diagrams through the usage of the unified modeling language (UML).","schedule":"Week 1: Introduction to Programming\nWeek 2: Conventional vs. Object-oriented Programming: Overview\nWeek 3: Conventional vs. Object-oriented Programming Comparison\nWeek 4: Conventional vs. Object-oriented Programming: Practice (I)\nWeek 5: Conventional vs. Object-oriented Programming: Practice (II)\nWeek 6: Introduction to Unified Modeling Language (UML)\nWeek 7: UML Use Case Diagram\nWeek 8: UML Class Diagram \nWeek 9: Midterm/Midterm Discussion \nWeek 10: Review\nWeek 11: UML Activity Diagram\nWeek 12: UML Sequence Diagram\nWeek 13: Practice\nWeek 14: Midterm presentations \nWeek 15: UML Object Diagram \nWeek 16: Off (dragon boat festival)\nWeek 17: Final Presentations (I)\nWeek 18: Final Presentations (II)\n-----------------\nActual contents:\nWeek 1: Introduction to Programming\n   Feb 26: From modular programming to object-oriented programming, basic concept \n   Assignment 0: Select your programming language(s) and build your development environment\nWeek 2: From modular programming to object-oriented programming, Exercises\nWeek 3: From modular programming to object-oriented programming, Exercises\n  Assignment 1: Coordinate transformation through files\nWeek 4, 5: Demonstration\nWeek 6: Use Case Diagram\n  Assignment: Prepare a proposal presentation showing Use Case Diagram(s)","scorePolicy":"Midterm Presentation\nFinal Project","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
