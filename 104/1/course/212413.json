Based on the obtained knowledge shown in bellow, not only students will understand the more detailed principles but be able to design appropriate processes for most of ceramic products in the future.\n　　Synthesizing principles\n　　Dispersing techniques\n　　Slurry preparing and casting methods\n　　Sintering principles","schedule":"The course will cover the following topics:\n　　Introduction to ceramic fabrication processes\n　　Syntheses of ceramic materials\n　　Surface chemistries of ceramic powders\n　　Physical properties of ceramic powders\n　　Concept about colloidal system\n　　Dispersion principles of ceramic powders\n　　Dispersion processes for ceramics\n　　Dispersion characterization techniques\n　　Additives for ceramic processes\n　　Casting techniques of ceramic slurries\n　　Drying principles and processes\n　　Sintering theory and processes","scorePolicy":"　　Course work will be weighted as follows:\nExams－ 1 exam and is weighted as 45 %;\nReports － 1 report and is weighted as 40%\nHomework and attendance－15%\n　　Exam policy: All exams and quizzes will be closed book and closed notes.\n　　Homework: Discussion on HW is allowed and encouraged, but copying someone else’s solution or allowing others to copy yours is cheating and a violation.\n　　Attendance:\nEach absence will get a -1%\nEach lateness* will get a -0.5%\n*Later arriving than teacher has to sign the late sheet.","materials":"　　Handout\n　　Reference books: \n－ D.J.
