In the belief that services in combination with products could provide higher profits than products alone, this course furnishes an approach of enhancing resource utilization efficiency to achieve the goal.\nIn order to identify, expand and test user’s requirement, research and design process will be carried out under the instruction, which includes Identify the Problem, Investigation Research, Identify Possible Solution, Choose Best Solution &amp; Develop Detail, Implement Solution, and finally, Test &amp; Evaluation.\nProjects must represent a meaningful contribution to the field of design base on supportive research.","schedule":"Cross-Disciplinary Design\n  ．User Centered Design\n  ．Universal Design\n  ． Design for Sustainability\n  ．Personified Product Behavior\n  ．Product Service System\nResearch Embedded Design Practice\n  ．the potential of embedding research in design practice\n  ．developing a science-based approach for design\n  ．the blending of disciplines in research and creative design practice\nResearch through Design\n  ．science by design!!\n  ．knowledge development by synthesis","scorePolicy":"作業及報告　　　　        50%\n參與討論與團隊　　　　30% \n服務與出勤　　　　        20%\n\nDisquisition &amp; Design Projects 　　50%\nDiscussion &amp; Team Work　　　　30%\nAttendance &amp; Support　　　　20%","materials":"　","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
