In this course, we will discuss how to apply the computer to assist the molecular structure design. In order to gain insight into the basic idea of structural designed, the fundamental background in molecular mechanics and quantum chemistry will be introduced. A practical software introduction will also be included in the course.\n\nOutline: \n1.　　Introduction\n2.　　Introduction to Molecular Mechanics\n3.　　Introduction to Quantum Chemistry Calculation \n4.　　Properties Analysis\n5.　　Optimization Techniques\n6.　　Molecular Dynamics","schedule":"Week 1.　　Introduction to computational chemistry\nWeek 2.　　Review fundamental theories: classical mechanics and quantum mechanics\nWeek 3.　　Force Field Methods (I)\nWeek 4.　　Force Field Methods (I)\nWeek 5.　　Electronic Structure Methods (I) \nWeek 6.　　Electronic Structure Methods (II)\nWeek 7.　　Electronic Structure Methods (III)\nWeek 8.　　Electronic Structure Methods (IV)\nWeek 9.　　Density Functional Methods (I)\nWeek 10.　　Density Functional Methods (II)\nWeek 11.　　Density Functional Methods (III)\nWeek 12.　　Wave Function Analysis (I)\nWeek 13.　　Wave Function Analysis (II)\nWeek 14.　　Illustrating the Concepts (I)\nWeek 15.　　Illustration the Concepts (II)\nWeek 16.　　Optimization Techniques \nWeek 17.　　Simulation Techniques (I)\nWeek 18.　　Simulation Techniques (II)","scorePolicy":"(1) 期中: 30%\n(2) 期末: 30%\n(3) 平時: 40%","materials":"Textbook : Alan Hinchliffe, Molecular Modellling for Beginners　　2nd ed.  2008.\n1.　　Tim Clark, A Handbook of Computational Chemistry, 1985, John Wiley and Sons.\n2.　　Ira N.
