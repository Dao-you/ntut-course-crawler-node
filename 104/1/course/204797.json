During the process of excavation, the water ingress or excess lateral movement of retaining wall might happen. This course will introduce how to reduce or stop the groundwater seeping through retaining wall and how to strengthen the foundation soil to reduce the wall movement. The soil improvement can be achieved by grouting or other methods. In this class, grouting technology will be the main subject to be introduced. It is recommended that Students should have the background in soil mechanics and foundation engineering to start with.","schedule":"1. foundation construction\n2. introduction of diaphragm wall\n3. diaphragm wall construction\n4. concrete placement for diaphragm wall\n5. failure case study of diaphragm wall\n6. geotechnical monitoring system\n7. field trip\n8. case study of diaphragm wall\n9. steel cage of diaphragm wall\n10.midterm exam\n11.type of grouting\n12.grouting in soil\n13.field trip\n14.grouting jacking\n15.grouting in pipes and conduits\n16.grouting of undergrounf structures\n17.field trip\n18.final exam","scorePolicy":"midterm exam 40%\nfinal exam 60%","materials":"Practical Handbook of Grouting, by James Warner","foreignLanguageTextbooks":false}]
