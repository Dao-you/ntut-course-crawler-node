Intermediate Chinese is designed to consolidate the foundations built in Basic Chinese and continue developing students' skills in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. While all four skills are emphasized, primary attention will be given to listening and speaking, since a solid foundation in these two skills is vital to the development of reading and writing skills. Upon completion of the course, you should be able to speak Chinese with some fluency on everyday topics and be able to write short compositions on simple everyday life topics. We not only educate you to compare Chinese culture with your own culture, but also immerse you in a Chinese cultural environment and provide you with the communicative tools you need in order to act appropriately in Chinese culture. \n\nClass Procedures and Expectations 上課程序和要求\nLearning a foreign language is like learning to play a musical instrument or training for a sport. They all require commitment and practice. Therefore, preparation before class, as well as punctual attendance and active participation in class is the key to your success in this class. According to our grading system, unexcused absences, coming to class late or without preparations will inevitably result in a lower final grade. \n\nNo make-up quizzes will be given for unexcused absences. However, one lowest score from your quizzes will be dropped. Students with excused absences (see Policies) need to make up the quizzes within a reasonable time frame. If you have to miss midterm exam due to family or medical emergencies, you should inform Liao laoshi immediately and make up the test as soon as possible.\n\nFor group presentation, you should collaborate nicely to come up a good presentation together.\n\nPolicies 規定\nAbsences 上課缺席\nFormal request for excused absences in writing is required. Even if you do not have a good reason for an absence, it would be nice if you could let Liao laoshi know why you had to miss a class. \n\n3-3 Rule: If you are absent for classes for three times or more (including both excused and unexcused absences), your final grade will be automatically lowered by one grade (e.g. an \"A\" will be lowered to \"A-\" and so on) for every three absences you have. Three tardiness to class will count as one absence.","schedule":"W1　　9/16　　Introduction 課程介紹\nW2　　9/23　　Lesson 2 Visiting a Night Market 第二課 逛夜市\nW3　　9/30　　Lesson 2 Visiting a Night Market 第二課 逛夜市\nW4　　10/7　　Lesson 3 Eating at a Food Stand 第三課 還是小吃好\nW5　　10/14　　Lesson 3 Eating at a Food Stand 第三課 還是小吃好\nW6　　10/21　　Lesson 4 Tea and Chinese People 第四課 茶與中國人\nW7　　10/28　　Lesson 4 Tea and Chinese People 第四課 茶與中國人\nW8　　11/4　　Midterm 期中考試\nW9　　11/11　　Lesson 5 Marriage and Match-Makers 第五課 我愛紅娘\nW10　　11/18　　Lesson 5 Marriage and Match-Makers 第五課 我愛紅娘\nW11　　11/25　　Lesson 6 Taipei is so crowded! 第六課 台北怎麼那麼擠\nW12　　12/2　　Lesson 6 Taipei is so crowded! 第六課 台北怎麼那麼擠\nW13　　12/9　　Lesson 7 Roasted Students 第七課 熱鍋上的「烤」生\nW14　　12/16　　Lesson 7 Roasted Students 第七課 熱鍋上的「烤」生\nW15　　12/23　　Lesson 8 Religions and Folk Beliefs 第八課 大拜拜\nW16　　12/30　　Lesson 8 Religions and Folk Beliefs 第八課 大拜拜\nW17　　1/6　　Final Presentation 期末報告\nW18　　1/13　　Final Presentation 期末報告","scorePolicy":"Attendance and class performance 出缺席與課堂表現　　30%\nHomework and quizzes 作業與小考　　20%\nMidterm Examination 期中考試　　20%\nFinal Presentation 期末報告　　30%\nTotal 合計　　100%","materials":"今日台灣：中級漢語課程 Taiwan Today: An Intermediate Course, 2004 Extended Edition (note: make sure to get this edition.
