Visual material will be presented to the students for their analysis concerning this media. Basic film theory is concluded in the course for understanding this media. Films will be used as a way to provoke students’ linguistic fluency and musings of Western cultures. The course will also take a look at the articles from TIME magazine and The Daily Telegraph to bring in a complete view of global conditions.\n\nThis course will take a look at the latest issues of TIME magazine and The Telegraph so that the students could have a more advanced understanding of the world. Also, to deepen students’ sensibility of Western cultures, this course will also take a look at (English speaking) Western Cinema, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who has inspired many contemporary western films like The Shutter Island and slasher horror-cinema. Through the media of popular culture, students could have a more immediate grasp of Western cultures in the process of practicing their linguistic skills.\n本課程摘錄美國《時代》雜誌與英國歷史最悠久的報紙《每日電報》的新聞文章， 讓學生培養有建設性的深層國際世界觀。再者，為了加深學生對西方文化的感知立，本課程也會從(英語系的)西方經典電影下手，譬如：懸疑大師希區考克，探討那些影響啟發後世電影深遠的雛形典範，像是六零年代的《驚魂記》對恐怖電影的範式開發。本課程旨在討論普羅文化的媒介作用，進而在練習語言能力的同時，也能培育出對於西方文化的即時掌握。","schedule":"1.
