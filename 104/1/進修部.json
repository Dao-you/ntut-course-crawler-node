As Paul Prescott has pointed out, “His presence is not confined to the ‘official’ locations of classrooms, universities and theatres, but permeates popular mass media such as cinema, television, tabloid journalism, computer games, pop music, comics and advertisements.” Indeed, Shakespeare has long been an inescapable icon. His words, characters, and plots have been widely appropriated to appear across a range of popular mass media.

Taiwan is vulnerable and at high risk to climate change because of geographic exposure and climatic conditions. Extreme weather events, such as heat wave, typhoon, and flood, bring catastrophic damages in Taiwan.
