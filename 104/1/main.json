control systems, Finally, the design of control system will beintroduced."},"id":"204349","stage":"1","credit":"1.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"四電四丙","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=104&sem=1&code=1575","code":"1575"}],"teacher":[{"name":"黃正民","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=11551","code":"11551"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["2","3","4"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"綜科322","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=203","code":"203"}],"people":"35","peopleWithdraw":"1","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"限30人","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3104092","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=204349&code=11551"]},{"code":"3204012","name":{"zh":"程序設計","en":"Process

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

The task of decision making entails choosing between various alternatives. This choice is governed by our desire to make the \"best\" decision. The measure of goodness of the alternatives is described by an objective function or performance index. Optimization theory and methods deal with selecting the best alternative in the sense of the given objective function. The purpose of this course is to provide a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods. To accomplish this goal, we include many examples that illustrate the theory and algorithms discussed in the class. However, it is not my intention to provide a cookbook of the most recent numerical techniques for optimization; rather, my goal is to equip the students with sufficient background for further study of advanced topics in optimization."},"id":"206435","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=104&sem=1&code=1965","code":"1965"},{"name":"電資外國學生專班","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=104&sem=1&code=1988","code":"1988"}],"teacher":[{"name":"張正春","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=11439","code":"11439"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["8","9","A"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教207(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=41","code":"41"}],"people":"18","peopleWithdraw":"3","ta":[],"language":"英語","notes":"電機所與電資外生專班合開","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105092","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=206435&code=11439"]},{"code":"3105102","name":{"zh":"電力系統保護與協調","en":"Power System Protetion and Coordination"},"description":{"zh":"一.電力設備的故障二.比壓器,比流器三.保護電驛的構造及動作原理四.常用的保護電驛五.發電機與電動機的保護六.變壓器的保護七.線路保護八.異常電壓的預防九.熔絲十.保護協調","en":"<一>INTRODUCTION<二>WHAT REALLY IS THE MVA METHOD<三>THE ABC OF THE MVA<四>WHY THE MVA METHOD<五>COMPARISON OF THREE METHODS<六>CAN PHASE-GROUND FAULT BE SOLVED <七>MVA METHODS FOR INSTANTANEOUS VOLTAGE ESTIMATE<八>THE SIMPLE COMPUTER TIME SHARE PROGRAM<九>CONCLUSION"},"id":"206437","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=104&sem=1&code=1965","code":"1965"}],"teacher":[{"name":"周至如","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=11244","code":"11244"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":["7","8","9"],"thu":[],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"三教211(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=44","code":"44"}],"people":"40","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105102","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=206437&code=11244"]},{"code":"3105109","name":{"zh":"切換式電源設計","en":"Design of switching mode power supply"},"description":{"zh":"1.簡介2.功率級電路3.轉換器架構與分析4.控制電路5.回授電路6.保護電路7.電路佈局與機構8.應用電路分析","en":"1.Introduction2.Power Stage Circuit3.Converter Topology4.Control Circuit5.Feedback Circuit6.Circuit Protection7.Circuit Layout and Machanism8.Application Circuit"},"id":"206439","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=104&sem=1&code=1965","code":"1965"}],"teacher":[{"name":"歐勝源","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=11214","code":"11214"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["2","3","4"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"二教304(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=29","code":"29"}],"people":"35","peopleWithdraw":"1","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105109","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=206439&code=11214"]},{"code":"3105128","name":{"zh":"排隊理論","en":"Queueing Theory"},"description":{"zh":"本課程之教學目標在使學生瞭解排隊理論之基本概念及分析方法，並據以分析通訊網路或計算機網路之效能。課程內容包含：(1)排隊理論簡介 (2)相關機率理論 (3)基本排隊模式 (4)各種排隊模式分析 (5)排隊理論應用於各種通訊網路及計算機網路之效能分析。","en":"This course contains the Introduction of Queueing Theory, Related probability theory, Fundamental Queueing models, Queueing models analysis: M/M/1, M/M/c, M/E/1, M/G/1, G/M/1 etc. This course also contains the performance evaluation of communications networks and computer networks based on the queueing theory."},"id":"206445","stage":"1","credit":"3.0","hours":"3","courseType":"★","class":[{"name":"電機所","link":"Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=104&sem=1&code=1965","code":"1965"}],"teacher":[{"name":"蔡堆","link":"Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=22668","code":"22668"}],"time":{"sun":[],"mon":[],"tue":[],"wed":[],"thu":["5","6","7"],"fri":[],"sat":[]},"classroom":[{"name":"六教224(e)","link":"Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=104&sem=1&code=422","code":"422"}],"people":"11","peopleWithdraw":"0","ta":[],"language":"　","notes":"　","courseDescriptionLink":"Curr.jsp?format=-2&code=3105128","syllabusLinks":["ShowSyllabus.jsp?snum=206445&code=22668"]},{"code":"3105134","name":{"zh":"行動通訊網路原理與實務","en":"Mobile Telecommunication Networks Principles and Practice"},"description":{"zh":"本課程旨在增進電機工程研究所學生對行動電話通訊網路工程實務之了解與分析設計之實作能力，期望學生之所學能與產業科技發展的脈動同步。 內容主要包括： (一) 電信基本概要簡介 (二) 行動電話通訊系統之演進與發展 (三) 蜂巢式行動電話基本網路架構與功能 (四) 臺灣GSM網路運作實例研討 (五) 無線網路之規劃設計與工程實務 (1)信號涵蓋之電腦模擬與路測技術 (2)通話流量與系統容量分析 (3)頻率規劃與干擾研究 (六) 系統優化與網路維運管理實務 (七) 電信公司營運機房與網管中心實地參觀 (八) 射頻規劃之電腦軟體模擬實驗: 在系裡經費許可之前提下提供學生實習網路規劃。","en":"This course aims to improve EE graduate student's knowledge in mobile telecommunication networks with emphasis on the engineering practice, as well as to train the students to be able to design and analyze the mobile telecommunication networks.

It is also the most emergent sunrise industry following the electronics industry in Taiwan.  The bio-technological industry is very different from the other technological industries.  The biological products intended for human therapeutic use have to face the needs of safety and efficacy except product quality.  Taiwan government and other countries have established the regulatory framework for biological products to ensure their safety and efficacy.  Therefore, the realization of the management system for biological products is very useful to industry development.This course uses the examples of vaccines, blood products,  recombinant DNA products, diagnostic devices and human cell and tissue-based products to introduce the design control, quality control, process control, evaluation for safety and efficacy and regulatory framework in Taiwan.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.
