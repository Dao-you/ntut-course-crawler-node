Optimization theory and methods deal with selecting the best alternative in the sense of the given objective function. The purpose of this course is to provide a working knowledge of optimization theory and methods. To accomplish this goal, we include many examples that illustrate the theory and algorithms discussed in the class.

It is also the most emergent sunrise industry following the electronics industry in Taiwan.  The bio-technological industry is very different from the other technological industries.  The biological products intended for human therapeutic use have to face the needs of safety and efficacy except product quality.  Taiwan government and other countries have established the regulatory framework for biological products to ensure their safety and efficacy.  Therefore, the realization of the management system for biological products is very useful to industry development.This course uses the examples of vaccines, blood products,  recombinant DNA products, diagnostic devices and human cell and tissue-based products to introduce the design control, quality control, process control, evaluation for safety and efficacy and regulatory framework in Taiwan.

As Paul Prescott has pointed out, “His presence is not confined to the ‘official’ locations of classrooms, universities and theatres, but permeates popular mass media such as cinema, television, tabloid journalism, computer games, pop music, comics and advertisements.” Indeed, Shakespeare has long been an inescapable icon. His words, characters, and plots have been widely appropriated to appear across a range of popular mass media.

In the IPCC assessment reports, much of scientific evidence indicates climate change an unalterable fact, so in order to meet the needs of present generations without jeopardizing the ability of futures generations to meet their own need, approaches on \"mitigation\" and \"adaptation\" needed to be adopted in response to climate change. Taiwan is vulnerable and at high risk to climate change because of geographic exposure and climatic conditions. Extreme weather events, such as heat wave, typhoon, and flood, bring catastrophic damages in Taiwan. Hence, proper climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures needed to be taken proactively to reduce many of the adverse impacts and to enhance beneficial impacts.
