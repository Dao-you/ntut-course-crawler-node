    "objective": "Heat is fundamentally transported by a temperature gradient; it flows from a higher temperature region to a lower temperature one. An understanding of this process and its different mechanisms requires you to connect principles of thermodynamics and fluid flow with those of heat transfer. A study of this lecture will teach you how to model the concepts of different modes or mechanisms of heat transfer for practical engineering applications.",
