    "objective": "The concept of photoelectrochemistry is to utilize the solar energy and other light sources to drive a complete electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction where the photocatalytic electron reaction has been converted into electrical energy. Photovoltaic cells which also known as solar cells composed of organic and inorganic materials and electrolytes are the great example for the photoelectrochemical reactions. Here the proposed course is constructed to introduce and implement the basic photoelectrochemical principles, measurements, photoelectrocatalysis, photoelectrical charge transfer and the storage of chemical energy. Further the remaining section of this course will be focused on the detailed studies about the development of different inorganic, organic materials for the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells.",
